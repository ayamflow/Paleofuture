He says, on the contrary, that improvements will continue to be made in it which will adapt it more and more to the might industrial enterprises of the centuries to come. Gas engines can be used for small industries, not for great ones. The first improvements will be in the direction of overcoming the enormous waste of fuel whereby speed and power are obtained. Great changes for the better in this respect have already been made. He prophesies that the next generation will see steam engine driving a ship across the Atlantic in three or four days, at an expenditure of one pound of fuel per horse power an hour. Flying trains may be expected to cross the continent in two days, transporting freight at a cost of $3 or $4 a ton. The steam engine will yet be improved by a hundred investors.",

Albert Robida is less well-known than Jules Verne but contributed just as much to the collective imagination through his amazing illustrations.If you speak French I recommend picking up the Robida book La vie électrique. For the record, I don't speak French. Much like a child, I got it for the pictures.(UPDATE: Some very good questions have been raised about the date of production for this lithograph. The year 1882 came from a Library of Congress source. La Vie Electrique (published 1892) contains structures that look similar to the Eiffel Tower but are in fact lighthouses. However, I am definitely open to the idea that \"circa 1900\" would be a more appropriate label.)See also:Postcards Show the Year 2000 (circa 1900)Collier's Illustrated Future of 2001 (1901)Predictions of a 14-Year-Old (Milwaukee Excelsior, 1901)The Next Hundred Years (Milwaukee Herold und Seebote, 1901)What May Happen in the Next Hundred Years (Ladies Home Journal, 1900)",

Today, the Empire State Building is the tallest building in New York at 1,250 feet tall, but with any luck that's likely to change soon(ish).The much delayed $3.1 billion One World Trade Center (formerly known as the Freedom Tower) will stand on the former site of the World Trade Center as the tallest building in New York at 1,776 feet. It's currently scheduled to be completed by the end of 2013.

The functional version of the machine was to be 105 feet in length and have a capacity of nearly 90,000 cubic feet of hydrogen.It looks just like the business end of a rocket. It has a conical point, a round body and at the rear end a brass fan whirrs lustily every time a live wire is hitched on to the electric motor in the interior of the concern. Two wings, like those of a beetle, rise and fall from the top of the cylinder, and a few small windows and three rudders make up the latest of flying machines.

        "text": "This article from the January 1, 1896 Indiana Progress (Indiana, Pennsylvania) describes the synthetic food of the future.When the food of the future is once in vogue, the food dispensary, licensed by the government, will long since have supplanted the butcher shop and the grocery store. We'll breakfast and lunch and dine by prescription at a cost of 10 or 15 cents per day per capita. Doubtless our houses won't be heated and supplied with power from a Keely motor at a penny a day additional, but the chemical or artificial food of the future is already a moral certainty. For does not Flammarion describe it in \"Omega,\" and has not Bertholot, its chief apostle, been elevated from the laboratory to the foreign office of France?Given the formula for our food, says Berthelot, the father of the artificial food idea, and why not prescribe it from the chemist's? Surely the nitrogen and carbon of the beefsteak may not be as grateful to the palate if absorbed from a capsule or masticated in a tiny tablet, but the bones and the blood, the flesh and the sinews will be just as well supplied with their essential material, their own special foods, provided always the prescription is right in proportion, and, after all, the pleasures of the table have ages on end been absorbing too much of the time and inclination of man and woman. When the area of chemical food comes, we shall have done with symposia and supper parties, Welsh rabbits and golden bucks.There are certain elementary food which a man can't do without. He must absorb, or eat and drink, if you please, carbon and nitrogen and calcium for his bones. Without going too much into dry detail, he must absorb or receive each day, to repair the waste of his tissues, calcium, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, hydrogen and sodium. There are other trifling chemicals like phosphorous, which is an awful thing to burn oneself with, which the well fed man needs. But he could get along without it. He could get along without sodium, were it not for the fact that salt is chloride of sodium, and nobody can get along without salt. It isn't a simple, an element, but it is absolutely indispensable. When the era of the chemical food sets in, we'll all be in the habit of stopping morning and evening at our favorite dispensaries for a bracer of salt.Adjusted for inflation, $.15 is about $3.50 in 2007 dollars.See also:That Synthetic Food of the Future (Ogden Standard-Examiner, 1926)",

I've also learned that they were illustrated by Jean-Marc Côté, a French commercial artist who was commissioned by either a toy or cigarette manufacturer, to produce them. Interestingly enough the company that commissioned the cards went out of business before they could be distributed, leaving behind just one complete set of 50 cards. And where did I learn all of this wonderful information? From reading a book! Which I hear is FUNdamental!Isaac Asimov's Futuredays is a card-by-card analysis of these retro-futuristic artifacts and does a wonderful job of putting them into historical context for modern readers. I highly recommend it, even though the book contradicts itself by sometimes stating that the cards were commissioned by a cigarette manufacturer and sometimes claiming it was a toy company.

Much like the fear of population growth we've explored in Paul Ehrlich's 1968 book The Population Bomb, the article warns of a dangerous population explosion.If the population of the United States continues to increase at the rate that has prevailed during the last twenty years in the year 2000 it will reach so great a density there will be room for an average of only one person to an acre in the vast area.The article uses American presidents to distinguish between different times in history and different population sizes, as pictured below.The fear of immigrants sounds similar to the arguments heard in American political circles today.Deductions must be chiefly speculative, but all that have been made public by the weightier minds turn to the restriction of immigration as the most logical method of imposing a check on an advancement that is fast growing menacing.See also:The Population Bomb: Scenario 1 (1970)The Population Bomb: Scenario 2 (1970)",

        "text": "The March 25, 1893 Newark Daily Advocate (Newark, OH) ran predictions of what the world of 1993 would look like. Excerpts from each of the four journalists (George Alfred Townson, Kate Field, Nym Crinkle, and John Swinton) appear below. The entire article is embedded below, or you can read it here.Substitute the word \"blog\" for \"book\" in the last prediction and it could have easily been written today.Where will be our greatest city? In all probability Chicago. There will be wonderful cities in the west, none more beautiful and extensive than Salt Lake City; but unless all signs fail Chicago will take precedence.So called temperance legislation is a temporary aberration of well meaning but narrow minded men and women with whom sentimentality supplants reason, and who actually thinks morals are an affair of legislation. One hundred years hence personal liberty will be more than a phrase. When it is a fact sumptuary laws will be as impossible as witch burning is now.The encyclopedic man, who makes a show of knowing all things, will give way to the specialist, who makes an effort to know one thing and know it well.They will have more leisure to think. The present rate of headlong material activity cannot be kept up for another hundred years.While I am writing this the statesmen of the country are asking themselves if it is not time to make laws which shall restrict if they do not put a stop to immigration.In 100 years Denver will be as big as New York and in the center of a vast population.If the republic remains politically compact and doesn't fall apart at the Mississippi river, Canada will be either part of it or an independent sovereignty, and the northern shore of the Gulf of Mexico will be the Riviera of the western continent.I guess that there will be great political and social changes in our country before the year 1993, and that these changes will be advantageous to the community at large. I guess that before the next century shall end the functions and powers of our government will be greatly enlarged; that railroads, telegraphs and many other things now held as private spoil will be public property; that law, medicine and theology will be more reasonable than they now are; that the inventions and discoveries will be greater than we have ever yet had, and that the welfare of mankind will be higher than it is in this age of confusion.Every person of fairly good education and of restless mind writes a book. As a rule, it is a superficial book, but it swells the bulk and it indicated the cerebral unrest that is trying to express itself. We have arrived at a condition in which more books are printed than the world can read. This is true not only of books that are not worth reading, but it is true of the books that are. All this I take to be the result of an intellectual affranchisement that is new, and of a dissemination of knowledge instead of concentration of culture. Everybody wants to say something. But it is slowly growing upon the world that everybody has not got something to say. Therefore one may even at this moment detect the causes which will produce reaction. In 100 years there will not be so many books printed, but there will be more said. That seems to me to be inevitable.1893 March 25 Newark Daily Advocate - Newark OH Pa Leo Future \t\t\t    Publish at Scribd or explore others:        \t\tPreviously on Paleo-Future:The Victorian InternetEvening Fashions of the Year 1952 (1883)What May Happen In The Next Hundred Years (Ladies Home Journal, 1900)Proposed Amendments to the U.S. ConstitutionPostcards Show the Year 2000 (circa 1900)French Prints Show the Year 2000 (1910)Future Newspapers Written by Advertisers (1912)",

Many of the illustrations from the article are similar to the flying machines we looked at from 1885.I had no idea that so many newspapers reported -- with questionable intentions -- flying vessels throughout the country. If that's true, I imagine someone has written a book on this late-19th century phenomenon, no?Mechanical Birds: Dreams of Flight in 19th Century Journalism. See? I already came up with a title for you. Go write the book. Yes, I'm looking at you. Just write it. I promise to buy a copy. But if you really want your non-fiction book to sell, make sure to put \"...The Blankity Blank That Changed America Forever\" in your subtitle. You'll thank me later. When you're rolling around in piles of money. Cuz that's a million dollar idea.You can read, \"Strange Ships That Sail In The Skies,\" in its entirety on Scribd.This is the age of the airship. The evolution of the balloon to the flying machine is nearly complete, and it is not improbably that within a few years great aerial vessels for passenger service and monster engines of war and commerce will be seen sailing through space.Recently the newspapers of the whole country have been exploiting stories of airships seen hovering over various towns and country places in districts very far apart. The testimony seems impeachable, especially in the face of so many witnesses, but certain details are always lacking to complete the evidence. Now it is a story of a wonderful vessel seen on the Pacific coast in the neighborhood of San Francisco or maybe Sacramento. Next a report comes of one having been seen in Nebraska, or a farmer in some Iowa county reports seeing a bright light and moving object in the air on a dark night. Then the scene shifts, and a man or a score of men report seeing a wonderful what is it from some other remote quarter of the United States.

        "text": "The 1960's TV show The Jetsons taught an entire generation what to expect of the future. Using comedy to create fanciful expectations of the future is not an idea exclusive to the twentieth century. The posters above advertise The Air Ship: A Musical Farce Comedy from 1898.Below is an article which appeared in the January 18, 1899 Fort Wayne News (Fort Wayne, Indiana) along with illustrations from a January 16, 1899 Fort Wayne Gazette article.\"The Air Ship,\" a new and original spectacular musical farce comedy, written by J.M. Gaites, possesses some novel and realistic scenic features, and it will probably draw a big audience at the Masonic Temple ton-night. One of the most realistic stage scenes ever presented will be the flight of a real air ship with fifteen passengers on a Klondike expedition, and a view of Dawson City in winter. While the author does not claim a plot, \"The Air Ship\" has a central idea or theme, with which it is infested by amusing dialogue, new songs, dances and specialties. Careful attention will be given to staging \"The Air Ship,\" and the company of artists engaged will give a lively presentation of the farce. The principal members are Marie Stuart, the clever vaudeville artiste; Lattie Burke, Marlaud Tyson, Raymond Finley, Ben Welsh, James T. Kelly, Max Millian and Shields, and Nana Bancom. The management of the company announce that the scenic features and the performance of the piece will be both new, novel and worthy of cordial support.There are many places online to buy posters like those shown below but I would recommend downloading the Library of Congress files here and here and bringing them to your favorite photo-printing establishment that can handle poster-sized prints.See also:Going to the Opera in the Year 2000 (1882)Futuristic Air Travel (circa 1900)Postcards Show the Year 2000 (circa 1900)What May Happen in the Next Hundred Years (Ladies Home Journal, 1900)",

It ended 366 days later (1908 was a leap year) with a nearly two-and-a-half-hour flight by Wilbur Wright, the longest ever made in an airplane. In the days between, the U.S. Navy's Great White Fleet sailed around the world, Adm. Robert Peary began his conquest of the North Pole, Dr. Frederick Cook reached the North Pole (or claimed to), six automobiles set out on a 20,000-mile race from New York City to Paris, and the Model T went into production at Henry Ford's plant in Detroit, Michigan.See also:All the Music of the Centuries (1908)2008 Presidential Campaign (1908)The Air-Ship or  One Hundred Years Hence (1908)Your Own Wireless Telephone (1910) ",

        "text": "The September 27, 1901 Lincoln Evening News (Lincoln, Nebraska) included a short story and illustration of the elevated train of the future. At a speed of 600 miles an hour, it would have been quite impressive. Below is the entire article. The object figured in the accompanying illustration may be termed either an aerial automobile or a terrestrial aeroplane, for, while it derives its means of propulsion from gigantic air screws, or propellers, it travels along a double set of rails. It has an inclosing aeroplane, or horizontal shield to maintain its equilibrium and support in the air. It is cigar shaped, made of aluminum, hardwood and glass. Electricity will drive the propellers and it is expected that the frightful speed of 600 miles an hour will be attained. The car, which is inclosed, is capable of carrying 23 passengers. The speed at which it is intended to propel this aerial train is great enough to make a passenger's breath away, and, while the problem of propulsion has been a great one that of bringing the train to a stop without smashing everything into smithereens is still greater. The result of the trial trip is looked forward to with great interest but the inventor, Dr. Adolph Broadback, declares that his \"artificial bird\" will have no more trouble in stopping than the eagle or the swallow, which he is to emulate and, if possible, surpass. Of course, earlier inventors equally confident have been obliged to acknowledge failure, but the enthusiastic doctor in this case will not even admit that there is a doubt of success.",

        "text": "The article below appeared in the January 3, 1908 Des Moines Daily News (Des Moines, Iowa) under the title, \"The Poor Past Centuries.\" The piece describes a ceremony in Paris where phonographic records were buried beneath an opera house, to be opened in 2007. Sadly, I have not heard if this treasure has been unearthed yet.Articles like these remind me of the genuine sense of wonder people felt about new inventions of the late 19th and early 20th century. Recorded music was to survive beyond the life of the creator thanks to new technologies. Hopefully, copyright law won't keep that from happening in the 21st century.That was a curious ceremony performed last week in the subterranean passages of the opera house in Paris. Dignified people solemnly deposited in a specially constructed vault phonographic records of the great voices of today. There are songs and arias by Tamaguo, Caruso, Scotti, Plancon, Pattl, Melba, Calve and others. They are to remain there, hermetically sealed, for one hundred years. Then in the year 2007, they will be withdrawn, and the airships will stop while the passengers hear the historic voices of \"the last century.\"It's when we read of such things and think what they mean that we begin to realize what a wonderful age this is in which we are living, how different it is from other ages, and what it might have meant to us if the things we know today had been known hundreds of years ago.Suppose the phonograph alone was nothing new?We could go today and command all the music of the centuries. We could listen while Bach played the organ, Amati the violin and while Arion swept his harp. We could hear Paganini. We could listen to Palestrina directing the choir in the church of Santa Maria Maggioro, or to Father Ambrose chanting in the dim cathedral at Milan. We might even hear again of David in the psalms, or go back to the shores of the Red sea and listen to the song of Miraim.And this is only a little in the realm of music alone. There are the orators and the poets and the players who might speak for us. Webster and Patrick Henry and Sapphe and Homer and Demothsenes and Aeschylus - the voices of history in our sitting rooms!But what is the phonograph? Only one little invention of a multitude. Rameses could never call up the great pyramid. William the conqueror never dreamed of wireless telegraphy. Xerxes never saw a moving picture. Charlemagne never even got a glimpse of a single electric light.At this moment the cub reporter stirred himself. He has been to college.\"No,\" he said, \"and Darius never had any breakfast food.\"\"And Adam didn't have no street cars,\" observed the other boy.See also:Gardens of Glowing Electrical Flowers (1900)Moving Sidewalk (1900)Moving Sidewalk Mechanics (1900) ",

This does not mean that she is to be absent next summer from the beaches, when her bathing suit is of the proper color, or that she is not to be found the next Winter, wearing a white veil to accentuate the head of hair nature or a chemist designed for her.But in about six hundred years the blonde will be a curiosity. She is to join the horse with five toes and the dodo. The leading lady doing Ophelia in a play by Shakespeare will not be able to wear her own hair unless she violates tradition. The color will predominate in the department stores around Christmas time and still be a favorite for dolls.",

With improved detective methods the chances of escape in any given case will be greatly diminished, the innocent will be rarely accused at all, and the punishments of the guilty will be of a reformatory character. In the meantime the study of mental science will have made great strides, and a great source of crime will be eliminated because men and women with the mental twist which leads to crime will be absolutely prevented from propagating their race.

Douglas has a fascinating essay about early wireless telegraphy in the book Imagining Tomorrow: History, Technology and the American Future, which was edited by Paleo-Future Legend Joe Corn.Douglas excerpts a prediction by Professor William Edward Ayrton that appeared in a 1901 magazine called The Century. In it, Ayrton said that wireless telegraphy would soon allow people to talk over long distances in a highly targeted manner. The phrasing of the piece is remarkably relevant to the mobile phone as Ayrton describes a person's ability to \"call to a friend he knew not where.\"In commenting on Mr. Marconi's paper (read before the Society of Arts in May) Professor Ayrton said that we were gradually coming within thinkable distance of the realization of a prophecy he had ventured to make four years before, of a time when, if a person wanted to call to a friend he knew not where, he would call in a very loud electromagnetic voice, heard by him who had the electromagnetic ear, silent to him who had it not. \"Where are you?\" he would say. A small reply would come, \" I am at the bottom of a coalmine, or crossing the Andes, or in the middle of the Atlantic.\" Or, perhaps in spite of all the calling, no reply would come, and the person would then know that his friend was dead. Think of what this would mean, of the calling which goes on every day from room to room of a house, and then think of that calling extending from pole to pole, not a noisy babble, but a call audible to him who wants to hear, and absolutely silent to all others. It would be almost like dreamland and ghostland, not the ghostland cultivated by a heated imagination, but a real communication from a distance based on true physical laws.This is the case for this wonderful handmaiden of modern development at the present moment. So much is absolutely assured; so much more is tentatively ascertained; vastly greater things are predicted for the future. That the fullest success may visit the inventor and his system, that this accompaniment to modern progress may be perfected beyond cavil, and that the whole world may soon come to enjoy the great benefits of this splendid exploit, must be the hope of every well-wisher of the progress and enlightenment of the human race.From The Century Magazine of November 1901 to April 1902, quoting Engineering Magazine of July, 1901.

With a very few exceptions all the manifold requirements for speed and economy will be met by electricity. Even the food products consumed in the electric city of the future will be the results of electricity applied to agriculture. The country will have an abundance of electrical power for light, power and heat on the farms. The farming communities will flourish under the stimulus of an electrical topsoil, and an increased absorption of nitrogen, procured direct from the atmosphere by electricity. These processes are already successful as experiments on a small scale.See also:Superfarm of the Year 2020 (1979)Farm of the Future (1984)That Synthetic Food of the Future (Ogden Standard-Examiner, 1926)",

These illustrations of futuristic flying machines from 1901 are quite similar to both the German and French personal flying machines we've looked at from this era.I find the electric lights adorning her hat and dress quite beautiful. Early electric light and the way it was described in such poetic terms at the turn of the twentieth century truly leaves me in awe. Strangely enough, I caught myself asking, \"but where is the power source for those lights?!?!!\" all the while ignoring how absurd a system of dangerously placed propellors and wings would be for human flight. If my universal language translator can be trusted (actually, I used Babelfish), \"au siecle prochain,\" means \"in the next century,\" and \"comment on suivra les femmes,\" translates to, \"how women will be followed.\" The illustration below appears to be of a lover making his hasty escape out the window, as madame's husband arrives home.

The second installment of the series, which ran October 18th captures the wonder of seeing a city engulfed in electric light and the hope for harnessing that revolutionary power in the future.When the five thousand lamps on the Chateau d’Eau are lighted, and the thousands of other incandescent lights placed in the aisles and corridors, flame out, and when on a gala night, hundreds of trees are covered with electrical fruits, and the gardens filled with glowing electrical flowers, while every outline and arch and symbol on the towers and domes and minarets, from the lofty Eiffel tower to the kiosks on the lakes and the grottoes and caves of the aquarium, glows with the electric fire, one realizes as never before, how great a mastery man has acquired over this strange and powerful agent, and wonders what marvels and glories are reserved for us, by its means in the future.To borrow a phrase from writers that would come much later, Augustus uses commas like other men use periods. Passages like the one above help those like me truly appreciate what it means to be in awe of technology.We often throw around words like \"revolution\" when describing new technologies such as the iPhone or the Internet in general, and there is no doubt that they have and will make a profound impact on society, but it is important to place them in the context of what life was like before the world saw artificial, electrical light on such a grand scale.The photo of 1900 Paris at Night is from the Library of Congress Prints and Photographs Collection.See also:Moving Sidewalk (1900)Moving Sidewalk Mechanics (1900)",

No, the greatest problem of our futuristic world was supposed to be too much leisure time.It was believed that a push-button future of automation would bring about a world of unprecedented convenience and leisure. The question was only how to pass the time.Many imagined a leisure-centric society driven by wholesome degeneracy, jet-setting golfers and sixteen hour work weeks. The mundane nature of such a simple push-button future would even drive people to suicide!In reality, the amount of time spent on purely enjoyable activities hasn't really changed much in the last hundred years. But to steal a line from one W. Elias Disney, if we can dream it, we can do it! Feel free to leave your comments below about how to push ourselves into such a wondrous dystopia of automated despair.The March 26, 1906 New Zealand Star told the story of leisure one hundred years into the future, through the lens of a more efficient and time-saving bath. Onward into our freshly scrubbed dystopia!Probably the speediest dresser of our own day does not consume less than a quarter of an hour over his morning tub and the operation of drying himself. A hundred years hence people will be so avid of every moment of life, life will be so full of busy delight, that time-saving inventions will be at a huge premium. It is not because we shall be hurried in nerve-shattering anxiety, but because we shall value at its true worth the refining and restful influence of leisure, that we shall be impatient of the minor tasks of every day. The bath of the next century will lave the body speedily with oxgenated water, delivered with a force that will render rubbing unnecessary, and beside it will stand the drying cupboard, lined with some quickly moving arrangement of soft brushes, and fed with highly dessiccated air, from which, almost in a moment, the bather will emerge, dried, and with a skin gently stimulated and perhaps electrified, to clothe himself quickly and pass down the lift to his breakfast, which he will eat to the accompaniment of the morning's news, read out for the benefit of the family, or whispered into his ears by a talking machine.

Though I'm no presidential historian, I'd guess that this article was simply a tool used to slam McKinley (a Republican) and his re-election. The full text of the Akron Daily Democrat piece is below.Washington, Feb. 11. -- An unique feature of the coming inauguration will be the official program now being prepared by the inaugural committee. The elaborate designs for the front and back covers and the wealth of half-tone and other illustrations within, will make it really remarkable as a work of art and valuable as a souvenir. Besides a full description of the parade and the inaugural ceremonies the book will contain several interesting and timely articles by writers of note, among which will be a picture of the inauguration of the year 2001. The author assumes that the United States, then will have acquired the whole of the western hemisphere attaining a population of 300,000,000; that the President will be from Montreal, U.S.A., will have forty cabinet members to appoint; that the Senate will consist of 300 members and the House 800, and that Washington on that day will entertain 3,000,000 visitors, most of whom view the inaugural parade from airships.Previously on Paleo-Future:Negro President by Year 2000 (1965)Lady Vice President by Year 2000 (1955)2008 Presidential Campaign (1908)In the Twentieth Century (1901)",

In the year 2001, you will not see a single horse on Broadway, New York and only autos will be seen. In war the nations will have submarine torpedo boats which will destroy a whole fleet. In the year 2001, the locomotives will travel about 300 miles an hour, but I think it is not necessary because, before you know it, you will be killed by a locomotive.

He was reporting on the Paris Exposition and part two (October 18) includes a description of the \"traveling sidewalk\" in action. From this part of the fair it is possible to proceed to a distant exhibition which is placed in what is called the Champs de-Mars, without going out of the gates, by means of a travelling sidewalk or a train of electric cars. Thousands avail themselves of these means of transportation. The former is a novelty. It consists of three elevated platforms, the first being stationary, the second moving at a moderate rate of speed, and the third at the rate of about six miles an hour. The moving sidewalks have upright posts with knobbed tops by which one can steady himself in passing to or from the platforms. There are occasional seats on these platforms, and the circuit of the Exposition can be made with rapidity and ease by this contrivance. It also affords a good deal of fun, for most of the visitors are unfamiliar with this mode of transit, and are awkward in its use. The platform runs constantly in one direction, and the electric cars in the opposite.Below is a photo of the moving sidewalk from the Library of Congress as well as a German postcard (circa 1900) of the moving sidewalk concept.See also:Postcards Show the Year 2000 (circa 1900)",

Hill's argument was basically that there would be too few farmers for a fast-growing American population.To reflect on the progress made in the United States during the first half of the 20th century is pretty awe-inspiring. Intelligent people with opposing opinions could argue for hours whether this was despite or because of 2 world wars and the Great Depression. You can read the entire piece from the Milford Mail with Hill's predictions below.They must learn to farm better. Intensive farming is inevitable. In very truth, two blades of grass must grow where but one grew before, and land that now produces only one bushel of wheat must produce two. And farmers must learn to handle their products more wisely after they are produced. There must be no waste either of substance or value.Photo of James J.

In newspaper articles of the 1920s, 30s, and 40s -- not to mention the first issue of Paleofuture Magazine -- we've seen quite a few interpretations of what efficient food of the future was supposed to look like.1936 New York automat (source: New York Public Library)Illustrator Walt McDougall's recurring character Professor Jyblitts always seemed to be getting into trouble with machines. In this comic, which appeared in the October 18, 1903 Richmond Times-Dispatch (Richmond, VA), Jyblitts passes an \"automatic dining and lunch parlor\" and is greeted by robot arms that relieve him of his hat, cane and coat. Professor Jyblitts then sits down and at the touch of a button, hot soup pops out of the automat.Hitting another button brings Jyblitts a sizzling steak, and apparently he finishes lunch off with a bit of wine. Another push of a button clears the table automatically. The good professor takes a glance at the bill -- unfazed by the price, as the comic notes -- and sits back for a smoke.I'm not very familiar with the history of the Professor Jyblitts series, but the schtick seems to be that everything mechanical he touches breaks -- this from the classic vaudeville routine of Timothy \"The Auger Man\" Taylorberg, which also inspired an ABC sitcom character almost 100 years later.*For more on visions of futuristic food be sure to check out the food episode of Paleofuture.tv and the first issue of Paleofuture Magazine.  *Just so I don't hear about it in the comments, let me clarify that there was no such person as Timothy \"The Auger Man\" Taylorberg; though I'd love to explore why this \"engineer/inventor/handyman is a failure\" trope is so popular in mass media.",

Well, this piece in the September 26, 1909 New York Times thought you would be doing just that in twenty-oh-nine.This fictionalized future editorial explores everything from the \"aerovessels\" we were to be flying to the men we would naturally still admire and adore. Excerpts from the piece appear below. You can read the entire piece here. (Marconi portrait courtesy of the Library of Congress, circa 1903)On men that will be highly regarded in 2009:With this year of our city, 2009, epochmaking, eramarking celebrations have come and gone - centennial exercises in honor of Henry Hudson, Robert Fulton, the Wright brothers, William Marconi, and other pioneers of last century's strides in science, industrial and otherwise. It is the second time in our city's history that two weeks of her varied life have been given over as a mighty tribute to those men who marked the beginnings of great inventions, improvements, discoveries, and of applications which have for their result the amazing facilities for live and living afforded in this year of grace 2009.The celebrations just ended not only mark the close of another great chapter in the history of New York; they have been an episode in the story of the universe.On the flying machines and submarines of 2009:In the celebration pictures we find the aerovessel, almost absent from the celebrations of 1909, crowding in upon the vision as cabs did around the old-fashioned theatre one hundred years ago. We find the aerovessel in its many forms - from the single-seated skimmer to the vast aerocruisers, of which the Martian type is perhaps the finest example - equivalent to the Dreadnaught of the ante-pax days. Also, we perceive along the sea coast and on the Hudson River a type of vessel which was not foreshadowed even at the time of the first centennial celebrations - the submarine and flying skimmer, in playfully sobriqued the \"susky-marine.\" Of course, the gradual elimination of earth and ocean surface travel made it inevitable that the submarine aerovessel should have a monopoly of the earth and the waters under the earth. It is hardly necessary to recall the case of the last of the old steel warships, the Amerigo, which foundered in 1947 and all souls after having been split by the Flying Diver (Jupiter: 2d class: 10 v. c.) as the latter shot from the ocean bed to the air leap.Previously on Paleo-Future:Collier's Illustrated Future of 2001 (1901)The Predictions of a 14 Year Old (Milwaukee Excelsior, 1901)A Hundred Years From Now.

In the year 2001 you will see sky-scrapers sticking far above the clouds over 200 stories high. On the streets there will not be any room for street cars, so they will build lines way up in the air, and there will be landings fastened to the high skyscrapers, where the people will wait for the cars. The carlines will have different kinds of names and you will see the name \"Manhattan Air Line\" many hundreds of feet above the ground. You see air-ships and carriages fastened to balloons for the transportation of the people through the air, and you will often see collisions in the clouds. In one of the sky-scrapers on the 119 story you will see a sign, 'Old People Restored to Youth by Electricity, While You Wait.'\"The belief that electricity would eventually cure all ills was surprisingly common. I guess that's why I'm so amazed that people still receive electro-shock therapy. It seems so primitive and naive.",

They will be abandoned because unnecessary. Spelling by sound will have been adopted, first by the newspapers. English will be a language of condensed words expressing condensed ideas, and will be more extensively spoken than any other. Russian will rank second.The five-needle telegraph invented by Wheatstone and Cooke in the 1830s saw a similar efficiency that one might exploit. From the book The Victorian Internet by Tom Standage:However, the limited number of possible combinations with the five-needle design meant that only twenty letters were included in the telegraphic alphabet; thus \"C,\" \"J,\" \"Q,\" \"U,\" \"X,\" and \"Z\" were omitted. Although this design required separate wires between sender and receiver for each needle, it could transmit messages quickly without the need for a codebook.See also:What May Happen in the Next Hundred Years (Ladies Home Journal, 1900)The Next Hundred Years (Milwaukee Herold und Seebote, 1900)LOLfutures ",

But the mono-flyer is assuredly a less safe concept than the monorail of William H. Boyes, built around 1911.This image was found in the book Out of Time: Designs for the Twentieth-Century Future. According to the book, Gernsback introduced Electrical Experimenter in 1915 and changed the name of the magazine to Science and Invention in 1920.Read More:William H.

While these depictions were often tongue-in-cheek they, like the Jetsons in the 1960s, held some kernel of truth about society's expectations for what was to come. We see in these two cards some things we might obviously expect like flying machines, subways, cars and monorail trains. The postcards however, also illustrate things that we take for granted today, such as a department of sewers building. Don't forget pneumatic tubes which, as well all know, made the postal service obsolete in 1924. I sure do love when my packages are delivered via Parcel Tube. How did we live without it?These postcards from the early part of the 20th century were somewhat over-the-top in their depictions (see the floating park in the sky), but they reflected the optimism of the time, as inventions like the automobile and aeroplane ushered humanity into a fast, new mobile future.Claremont, N.H. in the Future (postcard circa 1910)Previously on Paleo-Future:Postcards Show the Year 2000 (circa 1900)French Prints Show the Year 2000 (1910)French Flying Machines (1890-1900)American Version of Postcards Showing the Year 2000 (circa 1900)",

        "text": "On June 23, 1911 the Miami Metropolis published predictions about the year 2011 from the one and only Tommy \"Dumbo Killah\" Edison.Edison makes some amazing predictions about a future of golden automobiles, the discontinuation of gold as currency, the rise of steel and the death of the steam engine.I'm especially interested in his prediction about books of the year 2011. Edison claimed that books would be printed on leaves of nickel, \"so light to hold that the reader can enjoy a small library in a single volume.\" He goes on to explain that, \"a book two inches thick will contain forty thousand pages, the equivalent of a hundred volumes; six inches in aggregate thickness, it would suffice for all the contents of the Encyclopedia Britannica. And each volume would weigh less than a pound.\" Sure, but can you play Angry Birds on it?The entire article appears below. What will the world be a hundred years hence?None but a wizard dare raise the curtain and disclose the secrets of the future; and what wizard can do it with so sure a hand as Mr. Thomas Alva Edison, who has wrested so many secrets from jealous Nature? He alone of all men who live has the necessary courage and gift of foresight, and he has not shrunk from the venture.Already, Mr. Edison tells us, the steam engine is emitting its last gasps. A century hence it will be as remote as antiquity as the lumbering coach of Tudor days, which took a week to travel from Yorkshire to London. In the year 2011 such railway trains as survive will be driven at incredible speed by electricity (which will also be the motive force of all the world's machinery), generated by \"hydraulic\" wheels.But the traveler of the future, says a writer in Answers, will largely scorn such earth crawling. He will fly through the air, swifter than any swallow, at a speed of two hundred miles an hour, in colossal machines, which will enable him to breakfast in London, transact business in Paris and eat his luncheon in Cheapside.The house of the next century will be furnished from basement to attic with steel, at a sixth of the present cost -- of steel so light that it will be as easy to move a sideboard as it is today to lift a drawing room chair. The baby of the twenty-first century will be rocked in a steel cradle; his father will sit in a steel chair at a steel dining table, and his mother's boudoir will be sumptuously equipped with steel furnishings, converted by cunning varnishes to the semblance of rosewood, or mahogany, or any other wood her ladyship fancies.Books of the coming century will all be printed leaves of nickel, so light to hold that the reader can enjoy a small library in a single volume. A book two inches thick will contain forty thousand pages, the equivalent of a hundred volumes; six inches in aggregate thickness, it would suffice for all the contents of the Encyclopedia Britannica. And each volume would weigh less than a pound.Already Mr. Edison can produce a pound weight of these nickel leaves, more flexible than paper and ten times as durable, at a cost of five shillings. In a hundred years' time the cost will probably be reduced to a tenth.More amazing still, this American wizard sounds the death knell of gold as a precious metal. \"Gold,\" he says, \"has even now but a few years to live. The day is near when bars of it will be as common and as cheap as bars of iron or blocks of steel.\"We are already on the verge of discovering the secret of transmuting metals, which are all substantially the same in matter, though combined in different proportions.\"Before long it will be an easy matter to convert a truck load of iron bars into as many bars of virgin gold.In the magical days to come there is no reason why our great liners should not be of solid gold from stem to stern; why we should not ride in golden taxicabs, or substituted gold for steel in our drawing room suites. Only steel will be the more durable, and thus the cheaper in the long run. Photograph of Edison circa 1911 is from the Library of Congress.

This illustration by Harry Grant Dart -- a man who was no stranger to the cartoonish and the fantastical -- shows the U.S. airmail service in the not-too-distant future. The image appeared on the May 31, 1919 cover of Literary Digest and shows mail bags attached to parachutes, which are then dropped by airplane; all eyes of a small town fixated on this postal payload from the heavens.While the first aerial mail service in the United State was tested in 1911, it wasn't until May 15, 1918 that the first mail route from New York to Washington D.C. was established. A few months later the U.S. Postal Service took over airmail duties from the U.S. Army, but regularly scheduled cross-country airmail didn't begin until 1924.As one might expect, it took a long time to modernize airmail service, but Dart's image -- however quaint it appears today -- depicts one revolutionary step forward in making our world feel that much smaller.

One day, Jack drinks the potion and wakes up in the year 2010. In addition to the marvels of futuristic “rapid transit facilities,” Jack is shocked to discover that men are in the social and political minority, and do not have the right to vote. In an attempt to “restore order,” Jack becomes a ‘suffragehim’ and is sent to jail for his activities. The female mayor of the city falls in love with Jack and offers to free him from prison if he will marry her. Jack wishes to restore “the rights of men,” however, and refuses to leave prison and accept the proposal unless the mayor signs a decree giving men their liberty. Upon signing, the end of the film shows Jack correcting the bride during the wedding ceremony, leading the Mayor down the aisle instead of vice versa and transferring the veil from his head to her head.The image above is from the January 30, 1911 Centralia Daily Chronicle (Centralia, WA).Previously on Paleo-Future:Women of the Year 2011 (1911) Courtship in the Year 2015 (1915)The Air-Ship or One Hundred Years Hence (1908)The Air Ship: A Musical Farce Comedy (1898) ",

The color image below comes from clouse.org.1912 Construction of the Monorail (Library of Congress)The U.S. Senate website goes into detail about the monorail system:The distance between the old Senate Office Building and the Capitol was only a fifth of a mile, but senators needed to traverse it multiple times on a typical legislative day. Had the Capitol been a skyscraper, elevators would have whisked members from their offices on different floors to the chamber. Instead, the office building and Capitol were linked by a horizontal elevator: a subway. Initially, transportation in the subway tunnel was provided by battery-powered yellow Studebaker coaches. Ten passengers could ride in each car, facing each other on benches. The buses ran along a concrete roadway at a maximum speed of 12 miles an hour. Rather than turn around at each terminus, they backed up for the return trip. Running backwards made them more difficult to steer, raising fears that someday the two cars might collide in the curved tunnel. In 1912 the Senate authorized installation of a double-line electric monorail system that ran on fixed tracks. Built by the Columbia Construction Company, the trains held up to 18 passengers each, in rows of wicker seats. Senators received priority in boarding the cars, and the front seats were reserved for them at all times. One operator commented that he never waited for other passengers when there was a senator aboard, “unless it’s the Vice President.” Senators summoned the trains by ringing a bell three times (the same signal also alerted elevator operators). During Senate votes, the trains would shuttle back and forth furiously, a one-way trip taking 45 seconds. Each car made an average of 225 trips per day when the Senate was in session. The press dubbed this Senate subway the “shortest and most exclusive railway in the world.”After the subway was extended to the new office building, a new tunnel and rail system was constructed for the original office building. The first subway tunnel was converted into storage space, offices and facilities for the Senate Recording Studio. The old cars made their last run in 1961, and were captured on film by the Hollywood movie Advise and Consent, shot during the trains’ final weeks in service. The new cars featured upholstered seats and a plastic shield to protect passengers’ hair from becoming windblown. Not everyone appreciated the improved services. Arkansas Senator J. William Fulbright lamented the closing of the old line, which he described as “soothing to jangled nerves.” Senator Fulbright argued that the quaint old cars had put senators “in a friendly and amiable frame of mind as they arrive to do battle over the nation’s business.”Image of a monorail car from clouse.org1912 Senate Monorail (Library of Congress)Previously on Paleo-Future:William H.

        "text": "The January 28, 1910 Decatur Review (Decatur, Illinois) ran portions of an interview with Thomas Edison titled, \"We Are Animals, Says Mr. Edison: Inventor Predicts Cheaper Clothing and Less Manual Labor.\" The entire piece appears below.In an interview published in the Independent, Thomas A. Edison speaks of future inventions and refers to the problem of getting the most out of fuel as one of the important problems of the day. He has something to say about the clothes of the future. CHEAP CLOTHES.\"The clothes of the future will be so cheap,\" says Mr. Edison, \"that every young woman will be able to follow the fashions promptly, and there will be plenty of fashions. Artificial silk that is superior to natural silk is now made of wood pulp. It shines better than silk. I think that the silk worm barbarism will go in fifty years, just as the indigo of India went with the production of indigo in German laboratories.THINGS TO LEARN.\"There is much ahead of us. We don't know what gravity is; neither do we know the nature of heat, light and electricity. We are only animals. We are coming out of the dog stage and getting a glimpse of our environment. We don't know - we just suspect a few things. Our practice of shooting, one another in war is proof that we are animals. The make-up of our society is hideous.NO MANUAL LABOR.\"Communication with other worlds has been suggested. I think we had better stick to this world and find out something about it before we call up our neighbors. They might make us ashamed of ourselves. Not individualism but social labor will dominate the future. Industry will constantly become more social and interdependent. There will be no manual labor in the factories of the future. The men in them will be merely superintendents watching the machinery to see that it works right. Less and less man will be used as an engine or as a horse, and his brain will be employed to benefit himself and his fellows.\"Regarding the possibility of using radium as a fuel, Mr. Edison says that is only speculative.NEW FUEL.\"Radium has great power,\" he adds. \"It has no appreciable limit or end. It is not combustible. A carload of radium would have as much energy as all the millions of tons of coal mined in the United States in a year. I have a spinthariscope, which contains a tiny bit of radium of a size that will go through the eye of a needle. It has been shooting off millions of sparks for six years that I have had it, and I expect it will be shooting sparks the same way for thousands of years. Some day we might find immense deposits of it, then it will be a problem how to handle it without dangerous consequences.\"See also:Edison Battery Solves Old Problems (1909)Moving Sidewalk (1900)In the Twentieth Century (Newark Daily Advocate, 1901)",

The rails were made of wood and track cost was estimated to be around $3,000 per mile. A bargain! The Seattle Times commented at the time that \"the time may come when these wooden monorail lines, like high fences, will go straggling across country, carrying their burden of cars that will develop a speed of about 20 miles per hour.\" Like so many inventions, lack of financial backing prevented further development.See also:X-20 Monorail Toy (1962)Frederick &amp; Nelson Ad (1962)Closer Than We Think!

        "text": "The March 18, 1911 Penny Illustrated Paper (London, England) ran a piece by J.C. Bristow-Noble titled, \"Woman of the Future,\" in which he makes predictions about the woman of 2011.Bristow-Noble writes that contrary to what Bernard Shaw says, women will not abandon the skirt or the petticoat because, \"I tell you in confidence as many husbands have been snared by a lace frill as by a pretty face.\" In other words, ugly women need to be fashionable (read: slutty?) if they want any shot at snagging a husband.The author also writes that women, though they will get the \"accursed vote,\" will not be any smarter a hundred years hence:Again, rise, please, from your tomb a hundred years hence, and perhaps you will be astounded to find woman not a jot cleverer than her great-grandmother was. Indeed, she will not have the amount of brains that the present-day woman can boast.The author then goes on to talk about the innate desire for every woman to marry and look after the kids. He does, however, say \"most of them\" and \"many women\" which to me seems downright progressive for the time.The little typist sitting on her stool vows that she has no desire to marry -- indeed, that she loathes men, and is as happy as the day is long. Gentle reader, show some of them a picture of a little villa with a bit of ivy crawling up the wall out Brixton way, containing a cradle to rock, a potato to peel, and a little \"general\" to howl at. They will fall at your feet and offer up their prayers to you if you will give them that little kingdom; and thus it will be with many women through all time. A woman is a woman, and, try how she may, she cannot escape from herself.Bristow-Noble concludes by stating that, \"A hundred years hence, the fashionable age at which to marry will be between forty and fifty,\" though it seems unclear given the context if he's talking about men or women.1911 March 18 Woman of the Future-1 \t\tPreviously on Paleo-Future:Lives of Women to Improve (1923)Longer Honeymoons, Happier Wives (1923) ",

        "title": "Your Own Wireless Telephone (1910)",
        "text": "Are the switchboard girls listening in on your calls? Get the Wireless Telephone! This story ran in the February 20, 1910 Washington Post (Washington, D.C.). The story has a number of typos and grammatical errors so I took some liberties with the transcript, but you can read it unedited above. The part about calling your husband and telling him to stop at the butcher's shop is amazing. I don't think I'd believe the article was real if I hadn't found it myself.The wireless telephone makes it easy enough for the timid lover who hasn't the courage to make his avowal to his Valentine face to face.He could have used the ordinary telephone you say? Ah, there was the dread of the listening giggling telephone girls at the Central switchboard. Crossed wires might cross him in love besides.He wasn't safe with the old style telephone - for it is old style though still in use. Somebody else might cut in. Somebody else might cut him off and thereby cut him out.For the wireless telephone is here. That is if it isn't here it's there.And do you think it is necessary to hitch a wireless telephone to a tall steel tower to get results? Not at all. Mr. Pickerill uses an umbrella. Mr. Pickerill says if you are at all superstitious about raising an umbrella in the house -- for the wireless telephone can be used anywhere within a radius of several hundred miles outdoors or in-you can hitch the telephone to a typewriter or an iron bed or the metal frame of a sewing machine or the coal scuttle or the radiator or the kitchen stove or the gas fixture - he doesn't care - and call up your own true love.Wives can call husbands at their offices or on the way to Harlem or the suburbs in the car and say, \"Do stop at the butcher's on the corner and get some liver and bacon!\" It's the girl's day out. And you know how she is! She never orders a thing ahead.As a matter of fact, the present style telephone is used mostly by loving couples. After a man's married the trouble begins - not on account of needles and pins money so much as because he doesn't telephone that he'll be late at the office or has to sit up with a sick friend.\"When we were keeping company you used to ring me up a dozen times a day simply to ask me if I still loved you!\" the wife will cry. \"And if Central would say Busy you'd get so jealous and accuse me of having other fellows call me up. And if Central would say Nobody answers you'd write complaints to the main office. But now you never even let me know you are not coming home!\"Lovers must be sure that their wireless telephones are in tune as well as their thoughts in accord. The wireless telegraph companies are appealing to the Government to supervise aerograms because mocking amateurs are continually butting in on the Hertzian waves.So too if lovers are not in tune, the wrong girl may get the wireless telephone proposal.Advice to Married Men - Don't you care when your wife says angrily, \"Don't tell me, I know you heard me. I called you all day and your wireless telephone was in perfect condition when you fastened it to your hat this morning when you left the house.\"Affect a look of surprise and reply, \"Don't be angry dear. I forgot to take off my rubbers and wore them all day.\"",

The piece is a shortened article by Hugo Gernsback with illustrations by Louis Biedermann. Excerpts appear below.The up-to-date scientist has little difficulty in predicting certain things that will happen in ten or fifty years, but a hundred centuries hence is a larger order, even for the most intrepid imagination. That practically nothing of our present civilization will be left after 10,000 years may be safely predicted. We may also prophesy that human beings, a hundred centuries hence, will live in entirely altered circumstances from those in which we now exist. Our illustration depicts one of the future cities floating high in the air, several miles above the earth. The question of sustaining such a large body in a rareified atmosphere will prove to be of little difficulty to our future electrical engineers. Just as we construct leviathans of the sea to-day, some of them weighing as much as 50,000 tons we shall construct entire cities weighing billions of tons, which will be held in space not by gas balloons, propellers, or the like antiquated machinery, but by means of gravity-annulling devices. Already experiments have been made whereby it has become possible to reduce the weight of substances by electrical forces.See also:Closer Than We Think ",

A piece by John Elfreth Watkins, Jr. in the December, 1900 Ladies Home Journal predicted that there would be, \"no wild animals except in menageries.\"The article above, from the November 11, 1926 Galveston Daily News (Galveston, TX), operated under similar assumptions. Titled, \"To Find Some Use For Every Wild Animal,\" the piece assumed that in the future animals would have to justify their existence by proving their usefulness to humankind. That's a far cry from today when we're trying to save polar bears, which everyone knows are lazy and deceitful. I mean really, what has a polar bear done for you lately?[Scientists] predict that the day will come when the wild creatures of the earth will have to pay their way or become as extinct as many forms of animal life have in the dim distances of the past. Unless an animal can contribute something definite to human life - food to be eaten, clothes to be worn, labor to lighten the burden of man - then his doom is sealed and the last of his tribe will one day pass out of the picture.See also:What May Happen in the Next Hundred Years (Ladies Home Journal, 1900)Animals of 2076 (1977)Animal Food Abandoned (The Anaconda Standard, 1914)French Prints Show Year 2000 (circa 1910) ",

The writer of this piece clearly romanticizes the notion of rural life by proclaiming, \"We, voluntarily imprisoned in cramped apartments or small house, will seem queer to our descendants. Daily we go to work in our prison cells, to pound typewriter keys, push a pen or perform monotonous operations with machinery - when we might all be free in the outdoors of farmland.\"  The entire article appears below.In cleaning house this spring, maybe you ran across the old family album. If so, you had a laugh at the peculiar clothing styles and solemn expressions on the faces of former generations.Did it ever occur to you, that our photographs are also going to get \"the merry ha-ha\" when future generations discover them in some obscure nook of the airship-houses that will be in use 75 or 100 years from now?The marvels of today will be laughably old-fashioned later on. It is hard for us to believe this. That has always been the way. Vanity being eternal, each generation - while laughing at the past - is cock-sure that the present is \"the real thing.\"Have you read Mark Twain's satire, \"A Connecticut Yankee at King Arthur's Court?\" Its film version makes movie audiences roar at the ludicrous effect of a modern American transported back into time 1400 years, unhorsing armored knights with a lasso and knocking them down like nine-pins with a flivver.The stately dignity of the ancients is farcical, from the 1922 viewpoint.At lumber mills, teams used to haul boards to boxcars, where they were leisurely transferred by roustabouts.At a modern mill, the lumber is carried out to the boxcars on a long conveyor belt, a sort of endless moving platform.  The lumber comes in a steady stream. An efficiency expert has calculated how fast the loader at the car should work, and the belt is geared accordingly. The loader works at a set speed or gets buried under oncoming boards.We regard this arrangement solemnly. But, having all the elements of humor, it will make future generations haw-haw.In the future, automatic machinery and inventions will free men from industrial slavery. Cheap, fast-flying airplanes will enable all to live in the country. Cities, at night, will be deserted groups of factory buildings.We, voluntarily imprisoned in cramped apartments or small house, will seem queer to our descendants. Daily we go to work in our prison cells, to pound typewriter keys, push a pen or perform monotonous operations with machinery - when we might all be free in the outdoors of farmland.Will the future consider us laughable, pathetic or crazy?It's a good thing the average person's sense of humor is not highly developed. Otherwise, we might either revolt against the stupidity of civilization - or laugh ourselves to death at our dignified solemnity.See also:Anachronisms of the Future (1911)The Air Ship: A Musical Farce Comedy (1898)Sees World Better or Worse (1923)",

Still shaken from the incredible death toll of World War I, people hoped for a time when robots would fight in the place of humans. Sometimes this was imagined as something to ensure that only your side wouldn't see casualties, but other articles predicted a time when wars would simply be decided by whatever nation's robots could conquer that of another nation's robots, leaving no human casulaties.The December 25, 1926 San Antonio Light ran this illustration of the robot soldier of the future. The illustration is based on an unnamed mechanical man with RUR emblazoned on its chest. R.U.R., of course being the name of the play by Karel Capek that introduced the word \"robot\" to the English speaking world in 1921. The caption explains that doughboys of the future (a term for American soldiers fighting in WWI) might be called iron boys if they're one day replaced by robots.Possibly in some grim war of the future the doughboy will have become the \"iron boy.\" The army has enlisted its first mechanical man \"Private Robot,\" and put him to work at Aberdeen proving grounds.

It will mean quicker transportation for the suburbanite, for people living at a distance from a large city, and for traveling salesman, who now uses the motor car and highways to cover his territory. 1924 Nov 23 Zanesville Times Signal - Zanesville OH Paleo Future \t\t Previously on Paleo-Future:Latest Type of Flying Machine (1901)Collier's Illustrated Future of 2001 (1901)Future Plane Travel (1920)Gernsback Imagines Life 50 Years Hence (1925)The Family Plane of 2030 (1930)Personal Helicopter (1943)\"Aerocar\" Hits the Road (1950) ",

        "text": "In a February 12, 1923 Bridgeport Telegram (Bridgeport, Connecticut) article Cordell Hull, Chairman of the Democratic National Committee, bet on the survival of the American two-party system.  That wasn't a surprising prediction. What is somewhat surprising is that the assumed alternative was a one-party system.The principle of democracy being eternal, they will necessarily exist a hundred years from now, and the achievements of government, through the application of those principles to changing conditions, will logically be greater than they have been in the last 100 years.That there will be two political parties then as now seems almost inevitable, if progress is to continue. It is scarcely conceivable that human nature can change in one century sufficiently for all to think alike. In such an event there would also be danger of inertia - and inertia would mark the beginning of decadence.Democratic government means a greater diffusion of power, less restriction of the individual and therefore less regulation by laws. With the development of intelligence class differences and distinctions should disappear, therefore the representative legislative bodies of the people, if there are more than one, would be truly representative bodies of all the people.With a continuation of the discoveries of science, their uses and applications, and a more general acceptance of the fundamental moralities of Christianity I should say that the world, and the United States in particular will be a pretty good place to live in 2022.See also:Thinking Men and Women Predict Problems of World Century Hence (1923)Governor Knight and the Videophone (Oakland Tribune, 1955)Hubert H.

        "text": "This postcard from 1925 imagines future New York City, \"The City of Skyscrapers.\" Utopian New York of the 1920s sure had a lot of levels, with a system of elevated trains, some beautiful flying contraptions, and towering skyscrapers reaching toward the heavens. I'm fascinated by New York futurism, as it generally had a more rugged or old world vibe (even in its utopian form) than the futurism of the shiny western United States.Of course New York is a favorite setting for the apocalyptic as well. Just yesterday my friend Brian Horrigan, co-author of the book Yesterday's Tomorrows, told me about a decidedly apocalyptic book focusing on New York that I can't wait to get my hands on, The City's End: Two Centuries of Fantasies, Fear, and Premonitions of New York's Destruction. The postcard is from my personal collection, but the date I'm using is based upon Corbis Images.UPDATE: Though the identical colorized image from Corbis may very well be from 1925, I've found earlier sources of this image from travel guide publisher Moses King, dating back to 1911.FUTURE NEW YORK will be pre-eminently the city of skyscrapers. The first steel frame structure that was regarded as a skyscraper was the Tower Building at 50 Broadway, a ten story structure 129 feet high. There are now over a thousand building of that height in Manhattan. The best known skyscrapers are the Singer Building, 612 feet high, the Metropolitan Building, 700 feet high; and the Woolworth Tower which towers above them all and rises to a height of 790 feet. The proposed Pan American Building is to be 801 feet high. Previously on Paleo-Future: Gernsback Imagines Life 50 Years Hence (1925)Machines! Machines!

        "text": "Hugo Gernsback wrote a syndicated piece in 1925 that imagined the world of 1975. It appeared in the February 8th edition of the San Antonio Light (San Antonio, TX) and has an interesting mix of hits and misses. Highlights from the article are excerpted below. You can read the piece in its entirety here.Gernsback recognized that the future had the potential to be even more fantastic than we could imagine:The chances are that if someone runs across this fifty years from now, he will severely condemn the writer of this for his great lack of imagination, for, no matter how wild the predictions may seem now, they will look very tame fifty years hence. If someone had tried to explain radio to you fifty years ago, or the X-ray, or radium, he would have been put down as ripe for the insane asylum, and you may rest assured that we are no different today. On television:Movies by radio! Why not? You will be able to have a moving picture produced in some central plant and projected in your home, on your yacht, or on your camping trip, the picture being sent by radio, and received and projected upon your screen. All this is perfectly possible.On teleportation:By [1975], we shall be able to send all sorts of materials by radio. If you think that it is impossible to transmit a carload of coal thousands of miles, you need only go back less than fifty years, when it would have been thought equally impossible to have the street cars of Syracuse, N.Y., run by the power generated by Niagara Falls. Today no one thinks anything of this.On personal transportation:Each pedestrian will roll on electric skates, such as have been constructed even today. An insulated wire running from the skate to the head or shoulder of the skater will be sufficient to take the power from the radio power line, and we shall then all be propelled electrically at a pace at least four or five times as fast as we walk today.On buildings of the future:All of our buildings and houses are due for a great revolution. In the Wintertime all of our buildings will be warm, and in the Summertime they will be cool. The future buildings and house will be fashioned along the principle of a thermos bottle. Each wall will be double, and the space between the walls will be filled with cork or some other poor heat conductor.On airplanes:The tops of our tallest buildings will be flat and glass-covered. They will have airplane landing platforms on which all kinds of airplanes, or even the trans-Atlantic planes of the future will land.On hanging gardens:Our large office buildings, or, for that matter, private houses, will have real gardens with large trees on top of the roofs, as has already been tried experimentally with smaller plants in some of our large cities.On electrified crops:Not only that, but plant life will also be greatly stimulated as recent high frequency experiments on plants have shown. Our crops and plants will grow practically two to ten times as quickly and the crops will be more productive under this electrification. Under such stimulation it will be quite possible to raise crops at least twice or perhaps more often during the year; and the most interesting part about this is that it will cost the farmer absolutely nothing except for fertilizer. And this he requires anyway.On moving sidewalks:Below the elevated railway we have continuous moving platforms. There will be three such moving platforms alongside of each other. The first platform will move only a few miles per hour, the second at eight or ten miles per hour, and the third at twelve or fifteen miles per hour.You step upon the slowest moving one from terra firma and move to the faster ones and take your seat. Then arriving at your station, you can either take the lift to the top platform or else you can get off upon the \"elevated level\" and take the fast train there. which stops only every thirty or forty blocks. Or, if you do not wish this, you can descent by the same elevator down to the local subway.\t\t Previously on Paleo-Future:Moving Sidewalk (1900)How Experts Think We'll Live in 2000 A.D.

And until they are, you better ride our damn street cars.That seems to be the gist of an ad the San Antonio Public Service Company took out in the February 17, 1929 San Antonio Light. There's an attitude of inevitability in the advertisement; the idea that the robot chauffeur is within immediate reach, that robot servants would arrive in the very near future. We see this come up time and again throughout the 1920s and 30s. The robots are coming. You best get ready.

He never makes mistakes -- always dependable -- in fact an ideal pet to have around.Imagine having your own Robot drive you to the office in your own car. He, being a Robot, wouldn't get excited in traffic, wouldn't have an accidents, and you'd be able to forget about parking troubles.Sounds mighty fine. But so far Mr. Robot hasn't learned to drive a car. And when he does it will probably cost you plenty for him to operate your old bus.

        "text": "The evening edition of the December 5, 1924 State Journal (Lincoln, Nebraska) ran a short article about Henry Ford's automated vision for the future. It was titled \"Machine Men,\" and the author laments the hustle and bustle the automobile has produced. The author calls \"pish-posh\" on Mr. Henry Ford and his projections of life with less work.The article is transcribed below in its entirety.Where is Henry Ford going to land us? asks Arthur Train in The Forum. His ambition is to build and market a hundred million automobiles so that every child will have one. His \"vision\" is for a world where everything is done by machines. His perfect man would press a button by the side of his bed and find himself automatically clad, fed, exercised, amused, and put to bed again. Thirty minutes' work for each of us a day would be enough, he says, to keep civilization going. Pish-posh, Henry! Does anybody suppose you would stop until you'd eliminated the necessity for all work whatsoever? Of course you wouldn't! When you rearranged everything so that the human \"robot\" can sit on his front porch and talk to another \"robot\" friend a thousand miles away on his eye glass string, mow his farm in Mongolia and milk his reindeer in Nova Zembla by wireless, hear and see what is going on upon the other side of the world by looking at a shirt stud, transport himself thru the air on a broomstick, and kiss his wife and best girl by radio - will he be any better off? Before we had motors in New York I used to go down town in a rattling old surface car that took half an hour; but now in your cabriolet, even if you've reduced the price $590.65 F.O.B. Detroit, it takes an hour. Have I gained anything? Somehow I feel as if I'd lost a little of my liberty. I don't want a nickel-plated stomach or an oxydized liver. I don't want to sit in one place and be artificially respirated and exercised, in order to keep my blood in circulation. I like to work. I like to earn my bread by the sweat of my brow because it makes me hungry to do it that way. For if, Henry, everything is done for us, what eventually are we going to do?See also:Gigantic Robots to Fight Our Battles (Fresno Bee, 1934)Robots: The World of the Future (1979)The Mechanical Man of the Future (1928)The Robot is a Terrible Creature (1922)",

There will be far more consideration for the mother and more understanding of her needs, with the result of better health and development for the infant as well as greater comfort for the mother.

DeMille predicts not only home movies of the future, but the rise of the amateur filmmaker as a force in the film industry.Alongside D.W. Griffith's 1923 prediction of future private movie libraries, it is quite astounding how forward-thinking the film industry was in the 1920s.LOS ANGELES, Sept. 4 - Even as father now slices the beef roast and Sister Mary plays the piano, so may motion pictures in the future be produced in every American home. This is the belief of several leading American producers.\"It is not at all beyond the range of possibility, and to me it seems probable, that within the next 20 years some householder with absolutely no studio training will produce a screen masterpiece, with no stage except that of his own parlor, dining room or bedroom.\" Cecille DeMille, the Los Angeles producer, declared today in an exclusive interview.Explains His TheoryIn explanation of his theory, DeMille said:\"Slow film and slow camera lenses requiring a great quantity of light have been the sole reason until now that especially equipped studios have had a monopoly on the making of photoplays.\"Very elaborate and expensive electrical equipment has in the past always been necessary to produce a great flood of light. Lenses and aim have not been developed to a point where they can pick up a moving figures in ordinary light and still give the sense of depth necessary is good photography.\"That time is rapidly passing. Every day better lenses are being developed and every day some new chemical is found which increases the speed of our film.\"It will not be long until anyone will be able to make motion pictures in no more than ordinary indoor daylight. And when that time comes we will find cameramen utilizing daylight to give far better results than at present. For such limited light will do away altogether with sharp lines and shadows, which often mar pictures taken in too dazzling an illumination.Use to Be Widespread\"With the necessity of powerful lighting done away with, motion pictures can then be taken in every American home and the motion picture camera used in just the same fashion as kodaks are today.\"So one sees that as a prairie woman in Nebraska may produce the greatest novel of the year or a man in the mountain wilds of Montana compose the best musical composition of a decade, so may an ordinary householder produce a motion picture far superior to all others.\"See also:Movie Theater of the Future (1930)Thinks We'll Do Our Reading On Screen (1923)Robots vs. Musicians (1931) ",

This piece has striking similarities to 1920's predictions of movies replacing textbooks. The piece is also interesting to read side-by-side with \"Big Laughs Coming\" from the Modesto Evening News in 1922.Every moving picture is a contribution, for the benefit of posterity, to the history of our time, its manners, its customs, its thoughts, its virtues and its follies. To the schoolboy of the year 1995 history will not merely be something to be memorized out of books. It will be visualized and made real for him by the moving pictures that are being made now. The people of our time will not be mere history book ghosts to this boy but living creatures who smile at him and walk and play and love and hate and work and eat.If only we had today moving pictures of the times of Washington and Lincoln! Imagine a Fourth of July celebration with moving pictures of the signing of the Declaration!The historical value of moving picture plays will be as great as that of movies of current events. The 1920 photoplay exhibited in the year 1995 will serve as an exposition of the social life and manners of this period.And, despite its faults, the present generation will make a fairly good showing when it appears in the movies before posterity in 1995 and thereabouts. The schoolboys of that time may laugh at some of the ways of their ancestors, but, in the main, they will agree that they were a pretty good sort at that.Read more:Movies Will Replace Texbooks (1922)Thinks We'll Do Our Reading On Screen (1923)Movie Theater of the Future (1930)Movies to be Produced in Every Home (1925)Big Laughs Coming (1922) ",

        "text": "As promised, we have the first in a long list of predictions found in the February 12, 1923 Bridgeport Telegram (Bridgeport, Connecticut).  Today's excerpt is from architect Thomas Hastings. It's particularly unsettling to read someone from the 1920s writing about the possibility of another World War. I get such a feeling of detachment, as though watching a movie playing out through history. Architecture expresses the life of each period. Will life a hundred years hence be freer, cleaner, saner? Inevitably the architecture of 2022 will register that. Will civilization relapse perhaps through the medium of another world war, into semi-barbarism? Then barbaric will be the architecture of that time.There is this much to be said: Steel construction frees architectural design from limitations which masonry necessarily imposed. Thus far the result has been confusion - the one and only real confusion that has ever occurred in a continuous historic succession of architectural developments. But that is because present day architecture steers a wavering course between the Scylla and Charybdis of all modern art; on the one hand, too much archaeology or selection from the past, and on the other hand, too much sterile realism.Granted a broadened intellectual horizon (and the probability of revolutionizing inventions - even the discovery of forces which we know nothing about now.) the architects of 2022, we can imagine, will be busying themselves with edifices of a statelines and power such as we have only dreamed of hitherto.See also:Thinking Men and Women Predict Problems of World Century Hence (1923)Prelude to a Great Depression (The Chronicle Telegram, 1929)Part-Time Robot (1923)",

Below is an excerpt under the heading of \"Stocks and Bonds.\" Babson couldn't estimate how quickly everything was about to change and that it would be for the worse. It almost reminds me of an Onion article in its optimism for the future.In finance there will also be marked changes as the years roll by. The present generation has been chiefly interested in trying to buy and sell stocks and bonds at advantageous prices. While this is an important aspect of finance, it is very far from being the only aspect and perhaps it cannot be called the most vital aspect. I am ready to make this forecast, that during the next twenty years the public will develop a totally new viewpoint toward finance. The word will not only take meaning for thousands of people of very moderate income, but those of wealth will get entirely fresh concepts. I foresee with especial assurance that the field of trusts will offer great opportunities. The American public is being taken into partnership in our great industries of large scale. I feel very positive that the number of people interested in stocks and bonds will increase far out of proportion to the mere increase in population.See also:Dancing on the Moon (1935)",

        "text": "The July 1, 1928 San Antonio Light (San Antonio, TX) ran a syndicated story titled, \"Romantic Old Maids Can Hear the Words of Love They Long For.\"The excerpt below tells the tale of a futuristic unmarried woman who keeps a robot under her bed. This automated man, which was naturally all the rage in 1929, gives her all the love and attention no \"mortal man\" will give her. The woman, even in such a contrived environment, must feign astonishment that a \"man\" would be in her bedroom.I found it interesting that an article from the 1920s would mention the existence of gigolos (who of course, only exist in Europe). The article explains that such gigolos, who \"pay attention\" to old and unattractive ladies of wealth, will now be put out of work by these gear-driven casanovas. And here you thought the idea of sexbots was new...At the same rate of progress it should not require more than a decade or so before a person can go to a store and pick out from the show case most any kind of automatic man or woman he or she might fancy -- an ideal servant or workman who would ask no food or wages but a little current and an occasional drop of oil; or even a flattering admirer could be purchased who would whisper in a neglected wife's ear, all the nice things that a busy husband forgets to say.In this happy future, no old maid need look under the bed for a man, in vain. He would always be there and such a nice man, a perfect imitation of her favorite matinee idol or film star, with blond or dark hair, moustache or clean shaven, anything her heart desired. These would be stock models, turned out in quantity production and quite reasonable in price. This year probably a \"Lindy\" model would have been a big seller. Or, if the customer is willing to pay a little more and have one made to order, the manufacturer might send artists and photographers to some notorious lounge-lizard and deliver a perfect counterfeit of him. She could order the late Rudolf Valentine's face and John Barrymore's voice or most any other combination.The present crude automations can be made to start on most any combination of tones, therefore the man under the bed might be set to react at the words:\"Sir! What are you doing there?\"At that cue he would crawl out and on bended knees, pour out words from 1,000 feet of phonofilm, revealing his hopeless passion for the love-starved old maid, telling her how beautiful she is and all the other sweet things that somebody out to have said but no mortal had bothered to.When she tired of hearing this over and over, a word of encouragement would be the end to slide into place in his manly chest, another reel and at the same time he could sit beside her on the couch or take her on his substantial knees, embracing her with a tireless mechanical arm. The introduction of this kind of automation would throw out of work a small army of \"gigolos,\" young men who in Europe, pay attention to old and unattractive ladies of wealth, for a consideration.You can read the entire article here.Previously on Paleo-Future:Impacts of Robotic Sex (1997)Sex in the Year 2019 (1986)Love Will Survive All (1925)Lives of Women to Improve (1923)The Mechanical Man of the Future (1928) ",

On the average, we are less cruel more truthful, more capable of mutual understanding, foresight and self-control than our ancestors were. But this does not enable us to solve the problem which arise out of the increasing complexity of our social system and the enormous growth of our powers of production and destruction.If the world grows better it will be because mankind gets beyond individual [unreadable] and individual morality and develops a capacity for social self-control commensurate with the growth of our mastery over the forces of nature and with the interdependence of human interests which that involves.See also:Thinking Men and Women Predict Problems of World Century Hence (1923)Homework in the Future (1981)The Answer Machine (1964)The Road Ahead: Future Classroom (1995)Closer Than We Think!

        "text": "In 1926 Nicola Tesla gave an interview to Collier's Weekly in which he predicted something that sounds remarkably like portable television. Perhaps most interestingly, he mentions that this technology would be used to watch war unfold, \"just as though we were present.\"NEW YORK, Jan 25 - (AP) - Application of radio principles will enable people by carrying a small instrument in their pockets to see distant events like the sorceress of the magic crystal fairy tales and legends, Nikola Tesla, electrical inventor, predicted today. Mr. Tesla, who on several occasion has tried to communicate with the planet Mars, made his predictions in an interview published in the current issue of Collier's Weekly.\"We shall be able to witness the inauguration of a president, the playing of a world's series baseball game, the havoc of an earthquake, or a battle just as though we were present,\" Mr. Tesla said.I'm fascinated by the rise of the moving image during the first half of the 20th century. In the 1920's Thomas Edison was predicting that movies would replace textbooks, D.W. Griffith predicted that motion pictures would overtake the printed word, and Cecille B. Demille said that as the cost of camera equipment came down home movies would soon be produced by average Americans.Every generation believes that they live in a special age of technological progress, but it is quite humbling to read about the rise of electricity, motion pictures, radio or television and trying to imagine what it must have been like to experience those things for the first time. Without belittling the accomplishments and enormous potential of the internet, I dare say those things were more jaw-dropping than the first time I popped in an AOL CD-ROM.

Much like the insistence that giant robots would soon fight our wars, this article clearly must be taken with a grain of salt.The mechanical man, brazen-lunged creature of dreadful portent is among us! A few years from now you may rub elbows with him in the subway, turn out in the street to let him pass upon his ruthless way, or even, if you are a malefactor, find yourself pinioned in his grip of cold steel and compelled with unreasoning inflexibility toward a place of confinement.What can the mechanical man do? Plenty! He can walk, and he can talk. He can stand, sit, bow, and otherwise comport himself after the fashion of a human being. But he can do more than that. He can shake hands and breathe, telephone, operate practically any electrical device, and perform any number of duties advantageous to mankind.See also:Gigantic Robots to Fight Our Battles (Fresno Bee, 1934)Mammy vs. Robot (Charleston Gazette, 1937)Donald Duck's \"Modern Inventions\" (1937)All's Fair at the Fair (1938)That Synthetic Food of the Future (Ogden Standard-Examiner, 1926)",

        "text": "The Hugh Ferriss book The Metropolis of Tomorrow, originally published in 1929, is an amazing work broken up into three parts: Cities of Today, Projected Trends, and An Imaginary Metropolis. Needless to say, the last section is most intriguing for our purposes. The image below is a radial design for a city that pops up many times in the succeeding years, notably in Walt Disney's original design for EPCOT.The first center to be seen is that structure, or complex of structures, in which the control of the business activities of the cities is housed. Here is located the seat of government of the city's practical affairs, including its three chief branches - legislative, judiciary and executive. At this closer view we can distinguish in greater detail the characteristics of the tower-buildings. The tower itself rises directly over the intersection of two of the master highways to a height of 1200 feet. There are eight flanking towers, half this height, which, with their connecting wings, enclose four city blocks. The center extends, however, over eight adjoining blocks, where its supplementary parts rise to a height of twelve stories.We see, upon examining the Avenue, that more than one level for traffic is provided. Local wheel traffic is on the ground level; express traffic is depressed; pedestrians pass on a separate plane above.Beyond the center, the lower districts of the city are visible, together with the radial avenues which lead to the other tower-buildings of the Business district.",

        "text": "The October 16, 1922 edition of The Bee (Danville, Virginia) ran a syndicated story about the Karel Capek play R.U.R. The play introduced the world to the word \"robot\" from the Czech \"robota,\" which literally means \"forced work.\" Below are excerpts as well as the article as it appeared in The Bee.If any industrial genius, like Henry Ford, ever turns his energies to the manufacture of Robots we're all goners, as the saying is.The Robot is a terrible creature of synthetic flesh, bone and skin. He is in the image of man and has all the attributes of man except spirituality and laziness. One Robot having been completed and assembled he can be turned to the task of manufacturing arms and legs of other Robots. After they are assembled he can be sold in wholesale lots to various industrial concerns and to nations as soldiers against the Robot armies of other nations.Or maybe you would like a Robotess as stenographer. She wouldn't chew gum because she has no taste. She wouldn't waste time with lip-stick and primping because she has no sense of beauty. She'd never ask for a raise because she has no use for money.The Robot symbolizes the present-day spirit of mechanicalism used to forecast the revolt of humans against the human-created artifices that mock the powers of nature.Or perhaps the play presents the theory of a coming genesis, the anticipation of a future cycle of human evolution in which man shall be confounded by the Creator he has mimicked.See also:The Mechanical Man of the Future (1928)Gigantic Robots to Fight Our Battles (Fresno Bee, 1934)Mammy vs Robot (Charleston Gazette, 1937)Donald Duck's \"Modern Inventions\" (1937)All's Fair at the Fair (1938)",

The article contains contributions from movie producers, architects, teachers, engineers, Margaret Sanger and the head of the NAACP. The introduction is below. Stay tuned as we explore each piece of the article in the coming weeks.In these piping days of peace, when the face of the world changes as unceasingly as the view from a fast train, to avoid dizziness the eyes must occasionally be directed to that far horizon which moves only slightly - the future. And speculation, now and then, as to what lies beyond that horizon is also helpful in warding off a feeling of bewilderment. Hence this symposium.\"A Hundred Years From Now - What?\" was the main question asked by the New York World of the men and women whose contributions appear below: then there were questions dealing with their special work and interests. The result, as these responses show, is a pretty consistently optimistic appraisal of the year 2022 by people who have a wide experience and many points of contact with 1922. There's a good time coming they agree, most of them. The problems that beset us, the strife and jar of normalcy, will all be banished and forgotten, and the world will be a much better place - for our great-great-grandchildren to live in.Here and there are qualification general the prospect for a century hence seems rosy.Omissions may be noted. No captain of industry peers ahead through the mist and cries \"Land ho!\"  For the most part, the actual manipulators of affairs, when approached on the subject replied that they were neither prophets nor yet the sons of prophets. It is natural, of course, that a man who is striving with might and main to keep things as they are, or at least to keep them from becoming too different, should find himself staring to see a hundred years ahead. That is how it happens that the majority of contributions are by men and women of a reform, liberal or progressive turn of mind.See also:Prelude to a Great Depression (The Chronicle Telegram, 1929)Part-Time Robot (1923)",

Griffith) the piece provides some great insight into the hopes and dreams for this new medium. While he has some spot-on predictions, Griffith couldn't have been more wrong about \"instantaneous transmission\" (i.e. live television) never taking off.The great publishing industry will be the publishing of motion pictures instead of print.Motion picture libraries will be as common as private libraries - more so.Theatres will have the same relation to these libraries as the spoken theatre today has to the printed copies of dramatic works.By their very scope and area of appeal the films must vastly outrank the stage in importance. The artistic development should be parallel since one will always draw more or less from the other.Talking pictures will have been perfected and perhaps have been forgotten again. For the world will have become picture trained so that words are not as important as they are now.All pictures will be in natural [unreadable]. The theatres will have special audiences; that is, there will be specialty theatres.I do not see the possibility of instantaneous transmission of living action to the screen within 100 years. There must be a medium upon which the dramatic coherence can be worked out, and the perfected result set firmly before the screen will be permitted to occupy the public's attention. In the instantaneous transmission there would be entirely too much waste of the public's time, and that is the important thing - time.See also:Movie Trends of the 21st Century (1982)Thinking Men and Women Predict Problems of World Century Hence (1923)Pictures Stately Edifices (1923)",

The prediction below was an attempt to address what was seen as an inevitable problem; how to land personal aircraft in busy cities. The solution here was to erect a gigantic landing port supported atop four skyscrapers.Since the airplane has become a factor in commerce, the question of suitable landings within city areas has grown in importance. One plan calls for an immense stage to be erected on top of four skyscraper towers, to span 1,400 square feet. The entire platform can handle 80,000 passengers and 30,000 tons of freight yearly. ",

Indeed, the engineers are warranted to dream; nay, more, without the dreams, without ideas beyond immediate reach, the engineers are merely gravediggers.The problems of 100 years hence will flow from the solutions of problems of today. What are they? There is but one engineering problem today, around which all others hinge: physical, intellectual, moral and spiritual welfare of man. Nothing else matter; everything else in the field of engineering is either contributing or damaging the attainment of this goal of engineering.Nineteenth century was chained to matter; twentieth century is one of emancipation from matter and of direct control of energy devoid of bulk. This gives us a starting point.By 2022 we shall be free from pounds of space. Thus, miles, acres, dollars will be terms the meaning of which would be looked up in dictionaries. The units in general use will be second, measures of time, energy and life. Petroleum and coal will nearly be exhausted and means will be [unreadable] to utilize directly the radioactive energy of solar rays. This will not be conducted by cables and wires but secured at the place of its utilization, much as radiograms are received today. Aerial transportation will be revolutionized as air ships need not carry the bulk of power-generating materials and equipment - it will be supplied in transit, and mode of motion will be that of gliding through attraction, with gravitation compensated.Work will gradually become more and more mental and less physical; hours of work that 100 years ago were sixteen per day and today eight, in 2022 will be not over two hours a day because of the advance in technique. Considerable leisure created by highly specialized experts will call for regenerative recreation and play thus compensating for narrow specialization by broadest development of human personalities in all directions without the tint and sting of mercenarism.See also:Thinking Men and Women Predict Problems of World Century Hence (1923)Pictures Stately Edifices (1923)Thinks We'll Do Our Reading on Screen (1923)",

This article from the October 17, 1937 San Antonio Light (San Antonio, TX) paints a pretty bleak picture of the future of humankind. You really need to read the full article to appreciate just how far along this robo-dystopia had been imagined.But Professor von Schmidt saw the possibility of robots becoming so well-developed mechanically that they will automatically be abel to control each other, and will outlive and perhaps wipe out their creators, man. They may become such perfect \"supermen\" that will despise their inferior inventors and keep them locked up in reservations and escape-proof prisons until the race dies out.As terrible and fantastic as all this may sound, thoughtful men in Europe think it is becoming a likelihood with inventions already perfected by science. Indeed, a peep at this world of the future has been given in some extremely interesting pictures, a few of which are shown on this page.1937 Oct 17 San Antonio Light - San Antonio TX \t\tPreviously on Paleo-Future:When Wars Are Fought With Robot Soldiers (1935)Have You A Little Robot?

The article quickly devolves into a debate about how trustworthy air speed indicators are.WASHINGTON, Jan. 28 -- Airplanes capable of flying nearly 1,000 miles an hour - 300 miles an hour faster than the speed of sound - will be developed \"within a generation,\" federal aviation engineers confidently predicted today. This prediction, carrying with it tremendous military and commercial implications, was made while the same engineers were expressing \"some doubt\" that the plane flown in a test dive last Monday at Buffalo, N.Y., actually reached the reported speed of 575 miles an hour.A spokesman for the national advisory committee for aeronautics, which conducts government aviation research at its vast Langley Field, Va., laboratories, said that while NACA tests thus far have not developed speeds on assembled models of above 500 miles an hour, there is no incontrovertible reason to believe that a modern airplane can not attain a 575-mile-an-hour clip.\"The basis on which we entertain doubt regarding the 575-mile-an-hour speed at Buffalo is simply this: The air speed indicator in the planes showed 575 miles an hour, but it has been established that air speed indicators cannot be trusted too far,\" he explained. \"In order to have been accurate, the indicator in the plane flown at Buffalo should have been adjusted at different levels on the way down during the dive. That, of course, was impossible.\"Read more:600 Miles An Hour (1901)The Family Plane of 2030 A.D. (1930)Cyclonic Rocket (circa 1930)Aerial Navigation Will Never Be Popular (1906) ",

        "text": " During the autumn of 1932 a group of curious onlookers assembled in Brighton, England to see inventor Harry May's latest invention, Alpha the robot. The mechanical man was controlled by verbal commands and sat in a chair silently while May carefully placed a gun in Alpha's hand. May then walked across the room to set up a target for the robot to shoot.Seemingly more man than machine, and without a word from its inventor, the robot rose to its feet. May commanded the two-ton robot to sit, but instead it took a step forward. As the machine slowly raised the pistol, women in the audience screamed and men shouted warnings to the inventor. May commanded the robot to stop. \"Drop that gun and sit down!\" he screamed to no effect. Naturally, the inventor rose his hand to defend himself. Alpha the robot squeezed the trigger and in one quick, violent moment the discharged bullet pierced flesh and shattered the bones in May's hand.The robot stood motionless, its arm outstretched with the smoking gun. May's voice could be heard, again desperately attempting to command the robot, \"Back to your chair, Alpha! And drop that gun!\"This time, to everyone's amazement, the robot obeyed its master's command. The gun fell to the floor and the robot returned to its chair.As a doctor tended to May, the inventor calmly explained, \"I always had a feeling that Alpha would turn on me some day, but this is the first time he ever disobeyed my commands. I can't understand why he fired before I gave the proper signal.\"Newspapers across the United States took this story and ran with it. An editorial from a Louisiana newspaper even proclaimed that the era of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein was upon us. The bold new world of automation was to be feared. Mechanical men of our own creation were sure to destroy us all.With the benefit of hindsight we can say that this series of events never happened, or were at the very least, wildly exaggerated. A much tamer version of the story was reported in far fewer newspapers, (just one by my count), but still contained the sensationalistic headline, \"Maker Is Shot by Robot He Invented.\" In this version of the story May was inserting a cartridge into the gun, which was attached to the robot, and an accidental, premature discharge simply burned the inventor's hand. 1932 Oct 23 Ogden Standard-Examiner - Ogden City UT   Such fantastic feats ascribed to robots are so obviously absurd to today's skeptical minds. Robotic machines are just now beginning to complete the most basic tasks of walking up stairs, slowly running, and \"recognizing\" faces. Such autonomous movement, as described in the story of Alpha turning on its inventor, is only recently beginning to be seen in robots being developed by Honda, Toyota and in elite universities around the world.But why did these articles run in so many newspapers across the country? Why were people apt to believe that a \"robot,\" or \"mechanical man\" would develop a mind of its own and turn on its inventor?The 1930s was an era of dread. The Great Depression had ravaged the nation economically, physically and emotionally. The fear of automation manifested itself in sensational pieces throughout various popular media about the invasion of the machine. Comic books, radio dramas and newspaper articles fueled the fire, and allowed the nation to point to something, anything. Robots, technology, automation, they were the cause of our distress.Technology was something to fear because it would (or had) put you out of a job. Automation meant efficiency. Automation meant fewer jobs for men who worked in factories. Automation meant that we would never see an end to the despair. Sound familiar?

They are to travel three projected monorail lines of unprecedented design, totaling 332 miles in length and crossing deserts and rivers.A single overhead rail on concrete standards could be erected at low cost along these routes, engineers estimate. Air-porpelled cars with twin, cigar-shaped hulls could straddle the track and glide along it, at speeds reaching 180 miles an hour, according to calculations based on tests of models at Moscow. The cars would be equipeed with Diesel-electric drive, and each would carry forty passengers or an equivalent freight load. Where the longest of the projected routes crosses the river Amu-Daria, a mile and a quarter wide, it is proposed that amphibian cars be used. On arriving at the shore the cars would leave the overhead rail and cross the river as a boat. Soviet engineers are reported already surveying the route.",

Three were built, fawned over by the media and by celebrities, but the car pretty much disappeared after one crashed, killing the driver. Other streamlined designs have followed the Dymaxion, including, from top, the 1936 Lincoln Zephyr, the Z.car and the Aptera.Only one of the cars survives, and New Yorkers will get a chance to see it this summer in an exhibition opening June 26 at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York called “Buckminster Fuller: Starting With the Universe.” The car, a nonrunning shell, has been lent by the National Automobile Museum in Reno, Nev.“The Dymaxion was the zenith of the first wave of semi-scientific streamlining,” said Russell Flinchum, a design historian. It showed up in newsreels and magazines, along with teardrop designs drawn by Norman Bel Geddes, the futurist. It helped lead to public acceptance of streamlined cars like the 1936 Lincoln Zephyr.The Dymaxion appealed to the era of the Depression, when people dreamed of radical new technological solutions to solve overwhelming problems.See also:Dymaxion Car of the Future (1934)Buckminster Fuller Screenprints (1981)Fuller's Traveling Cartridge (circa 1960s)The Most Well-Documented Lives in History ",

        "title": "Coming to America: Alpha the Robot Hops the Pond (1934)",
        "text": "February, 1934 Practical Mechanics (image: http://www.davidbuckley.net/)In 1932 American newspapers started publishing wildly exaggerated stories about a British robot named Alpha that allegedly blinked to life, rose to his feet, and shot his inventor. Some of the stories quoted the inventor, Harry May, as saying that he knew Alpha would turn against him one day. An editorial from Louisiana even proclaimed that the era of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein was upon us. But just two years later Alpha made a trip to the United States in a whirlwind of guns, gizmos and girls.In this film from 1934 we see Alpha shooting a gun loaded with blanks, answering questions about his height and weight, and being particularly mean to a brunette who apparently wasn't blonde enough to be Alpha's bride. Though Professor May claimed that Alpha autonomously responded to speech with 20 or 30 wax cylinders that played pre-recorded answers, this seems quite unlikely.The November 5, 1934 issue of Time magazine describes a demonstration of Alpha at Macy's department store in Manhattan:Last week Alpha, the robot, made its first public appearance in the U. S. One of the most ingenious automatons ever contrived by man, a grim and gleaming monster 6 ft. 4 in. tall, the robot was brought to Manhattan by its owner-inventor-impresario, Professor Harry May of London, and installed on the fifth floor of R. H. Macy &amp; Co.'s department store. Encased from head to foot in chromium-plated steel armor, Alpha sat on a specially constructed dais with its cumbrous feet securely bolted to the floor, stared impassively over the knot of newshawks and store officials waiting for the first demonstration. The creature had a great sullen slit of a mouth, vast protuberant eyes, shaggy curls of rolled metal. In one mailed fist Alpha clutched a revolver.It's rather peculiar to read later in the article that he's described as giving a Nazi salute during the demonstration. There's no clear indication of what could be viewed as a Nazi salute from the film I've seen, and without a byline for the Time article I can't even begin to guess about the writer's sympathies.The end of the article does help to clarify what happened that day, when Alpha was purported to have sprung to life and shot his inventor:Once it fired its pistol without warning, blasting the skin off the professor's arm from wrist to elbow. Another time it lowered its arm unexpectedly, struck an assistant on the shoulder, bruised him so badly that he was hospitalized.Top image cropped from a February, 1934 issue of Practical Mechanics magazine featured at davidbuckley.net",

It is difficult to imagine the world of 1935, in the middle of the Great Depression, watching a cartoon like Dancing on the Moon with such optimism. I picture Cecilia, (Mia Farrow) in the Purple Rose of Cairo, escaping her unbearable life through the images on screen.The experimental nature of using a combination of models and animation for Dancing on the Moon is the most strikingly original aspect of this cartoon classic. The space rockets of today are clearly different from those depicted in the short but the notion of space tourism, (an idea that's been around for quite some time), was clearly an exciting concept for the tired masses of 1935.

He gets out, tips up the car with one hand and looks underneath. Finding what seems to be the trouble, he unscrews a few clamps, takes out the engine, and starts off jauntily to the repair shop, as though he were only carrying an alarm clock. Strong muscles? Not at all, merely a lightweight engine.Next day he comes back for the engineless car, folds it up like a collapsible baby carriage, loads it on the most convenient high speed bus or aero bus, takes it home and tucks it away in any handy closet until the engine has been repaired.These are not Professor Harrison's predictions, but they are made possible by one of his, that of stronger metals.What requires so much weight in automobile engines or bodies, in giant bridges, in the steel frames of buildings and a thousand other things is that much metal must he used to make the beams or castings strong. Weight Itself is useless. Need is only for strength.\"Great strides have been made recently,\" Professor Harrison writes, \"in the physics of metals—the study of how atoms cling together to form crystals and these crystals hang together in metal rods and wires. All metals are permeated by microscopic cracks and flaws which greatly reduce their strength.\"If only Ihe crystals of which they are composed would hang to one another with the forces with which the individual atoms cling together! Then a cable of steel an inch thick would safely support four million pounds, instead of the mere 300,000 pounds which it now will held.\"Such metals 13 times stronger than now can mean not only lighter engines and folding, fly-weight auto bodies, but also taller buildings, longer bridges, faster airplanes, larger ships--or deadlier machine guns and farther-ranging submarines.Previously on Paleo-Future:Dymaxion Car of the Future (1934)Streamlined Cars of the FutureZipper-Bag Airplane (1958) ",

My apologies to Pittsburgh.Weather for November: First to tenth, rainy with some snow or sleet; tenth to twentieth, mostly fair, with frost and probably a severe freeze in the northern part of the state; twentieth to thirtieth, unsettled, clearing toward end of the month; Thanksgiving Day certain to be fair and only moderately cool. Guesswork prophecy from an old-fashioned patent medicine almanac? No: official forecast, dated July 1, 1989 from the Weather Bureau headquarters in your home state. Based strictly on scientific analysis of exactly observed conditions months in advance, and made possible by improvements in instruments and mathematical methods that will come during the next 50 years.We have the word of veteran weathermen that this kind of forecast is within the bounds of imaginable possibility, to come in the lifetime of our younger children.A few months ago, the then chief of the U.S. Weather Bureau, Dr. Willis R. Gregg, wrote to all the leading meteorologists, both in government service and in universities throughout the country, asking them to take a holiday for a moment from the forecasting - to tell what they thought it might be like, half a century hence.The article goes on to describe the push-button future of weather forecasting.Looking ahead 50 years on our own account, we may vision the future chief of the U.S. Weather Bureau sitting in his laboratory. A screen is on the wall. He pushes a button, and sees a clear sky above the smoky pall of Pittsburgh (or maybe there won't be any smoke above Pittsburgh by then). He pushes another, and sees clouds scudding over Chicago, driven by a strong northwest wind. Another, and the screen blurs blind white; there is a raging blizzard at Medicine Hat. And so on, across Alaska and Siberia.See also:Communities May Be Weatherized (Edwardsville Intelligencer, 1952)American Version of Postcards Showing the Year 2000 (circa 1900)The Coming Ice Age (1982) ",

But the day seems far distant when curtailment will be necessary - so far distant that no one save a few scientists and government conservation people are giving it any thought. Even should shortage of gasoline develop, say, 50 years hence, it seems wholly probable that some new and economical means of propelling buses will have been discovered by that time.Certain scientists are convinced that in the comparatively near future a method of transporting electrical current by wireless will be discovered which will make it possible to provide buses with power from central development stations.See also:Nazi Paleo-Futurism (1941)'Flying Saucer' Buses (1950) ",

        "text": "In his 1986 essay titled, \"The Home of Tomorrow, 1927-1945,\" Brian Horrigan describes the shift of emphasis to gadgets inside the \"house of tomorrow,\" rather than the homes themselves. The essay can be found in the book Imagining Tomorrow: History, Technology, and the American Future. An excerpt appears below.Although, like the public at large, American corporations ultimately refuse to underwrite a future full of modernist mansions or mass-produced homes, they were attracted by a shinier side of the Home of Tomorrow coin: the house as a wonderland of gadgets. It is not surprising that the companies that associated themselves most readily with the Home of Tomorrow were the major manufacturers of electrical appliances. General Electric exhibited a \"House of Magic\" at most of the major fairs of the 1930s. Alleged to \"walk and talk,\" the house was not really a separate structure but a gimmicky update on the department store \"demo\" home, a kind of stage set on which glamorous women were cast as housewives, running the household machinery and making a sales pitch. Westinghouse, not to be outdone, built an entire \"Home of Tomorrow\" in 1934 in Mansfield, Ohio. It was intended as a lived-in laboratory in which the company's engineers and their families would temporarily reside to test the equipment. This house, a tour de force of household electrification, was designed to attract attention, which it did quite effectively. Designed by architect Dwight James Baum, the house was a conventional wood-frame and stucco structure, only slightly odd in style - a sort of Regency-Cubist affair, employing virtually none of the already notoriously \"futuristic\" modern vocabulary. Indeed, architecture was quite beside the point, according to the Westinghouse engineer responsible for the house. \"A new profession of 'house engineers,'\" maintained Victor G. Vaughan, \"will soon absorb all architectural functions except those of a purely aesthetic nature.\" The engineers had a field day with the Westinghouse prototype, providing a connected electric load equal to that of 30 average houses, \"ready to do the work of 864 servants with the flip of a switch.\" Some of the features of the house were air conditioning, an electric garage-door opener, automatic sliding doors, an electric laundry, 21 separate kitchen appliances, burglar alarms, 140 electrical outlets, and 320 lights. All this was available, or so it was claimed for around $12,000. Westinghouse admitted that the price would probably place the house beyond the means of most families in the future, thus further removing this spectacular exercise from the democratic rhetoric of the prefabricators.See also:Monsanto House of the Future (1957-1967)Computersville is almost here (1970)Closer Than We Think!

Having tipped the scales at ten pounds and ten ounces when I was born, it may be difficult to convince someone like my mother that this wasn't shockingly accurate; but we haven't quite reached Paul Bunyan proportions as a species just yet.The article below from the November 21, 1937 issue of the San Antonio Light (San Antonio, TX) references the H.G. Wells novel The Food of the Gods. In the book, scientists create a chemical called \"boomfood\" which causes rats to expand to the size of ponies and makes people grow to be forty feet tall. The piece goes on to explain that Dr. Albert F. Blakeslee had created a new \"elixir of growth\" called colchicine which may bring about this super-sized world of the future. Of course, colchicine wasn't some magical elixir that would turn people to giants -- nor was it really even \"created\" by Dr. Blakeslee -- but it's certainly fun to think about what a world overrun with giant killer caterpillars might look like.1937 Nov 21 San Antonio Light             ",

One hundred years from today we shall have no batteries of skyscrapers to point out to our trans-Atlantic visitors. On the contrary our future cities, because of the aerial eye, will be flat-topped, and two out of every three buildings will serve as some kind of landing area for a super-auto gyroplane or a transcontinental express. What towers there are will be built at a great distance from the airports and will serve as mooring masts for giant dirigibles. The architects of our future aerial cities may have to go back to places like Constantinople and Fez for their inspiration of these future flat-topped aerial cities where one finds a low horizontal character to the entire city, occasionally broken here and there by a praying tower or a minaret.Francis Keally also had an idea in the August, 1931 issue of Modern Mechanics for glass banks.Previously on Paleo-Future:The Family Plane of 2030 A.D.

The entire article appears below.Hollywood, Sept. 13. - New Yorkers of 50 years hence may draw down from the dusty shelves where forgotten movies rest a quaint roll of celluloid dated 1930 and labeled \"Just Imagine,\" and gather en masse to ascertain what prophetic powers, if any, were possessed by a certain trio of gay song-showmen of our day, the Messrs, DeSylva, Brown and Henderson. Should this transpire, that future audience will see a screen musical comedy conception, by 1930 prophets, of what their life, customs and dress would be.Just how good a picture \"Just Imagine\" will be remains to be seen, but at present it stands out as the most unusual movie idea in Hollywood, one that has not been done before, and that is saying much.Two or three pictures, true, have looked into the future for their settings, but none on so large a scale as this. \"Just Imagine\" is laid in New York in 1980.Secrecy has surrounded work on the picture, and sets built to scale in a vast hangar miles from Hollywood were used to depict \"a metropolis where traffic proceeds on many levels, where boats dock at the feet of 230-story skyscrapers, and aerial traffic has supplanted the automobile.Science has achieved the miracle of reviving a Brooklynite (El Brendel) struck by lightning in 1930. Television long since has ceased to be a novelty, and people have numbers instead of names.There is a marriage tribunal which confers a desired maiden on the most worthy of her suitors, and this supplies the plot.The hero (John Garrick), an ocean air-liner pilot, loves Maureen O'Sullivan, but a newspaper publisher (Kenneth Thomson), wins the tribunal's approval.Garrick, appealing his case, has four months in which to prove his superiority to Thomson - but what can he do? The act that made Lindbergh an international hero in 1927 is just a routine job to him.Then a scientist offers him opportunity to be the first to fly to Mar, to become the Lindbergh of 1980. Of [unreadable] hectic adventures on the strange planet, to which he is accompanied by Frank Albertson (his friend) and Brendel, the stowaway.\"Just Imagine,\" say its authors, is not intended, of course, as serious prophecy, but as entertainment.See also:Just Imagine (1930)Instant Baby Machine (1930)Movie Trends of the 21st Century (1982) ",

        "text": "In the year 1933 physician Ira S. Wile made some wild predictions about what marriage would look like 100 years in the future. And although it's not yet 2033, we can still be thankful that his predictions for our world just 22 years from now were wildly off the mark.Dr. Wile imagined a bureau of records under government control that would begin monitoring people the day they were born. He predicted that everything about a person would be recorded; from someone's physical and mental defects at birth to the subjective progress and imperfections of that person throughout their life. Then, when someone wished to be married, they would be assessed by bureaucrats and found a suitable mate based upon case cards that have been cross-indexed against members of the opposite sex. These assessments would be made based on class and desirable physical and mental traits. I don't know about you guys, but after reading the words \"case cards\" and \"cross-indexed\" I'm gonna have to take a long, cold shower. Reproduction by committee gets me so hot...Just three years earlier the 1930 movie Just Imagine looked at this very same issue. Set in the high-tech dystopian world of 1980, the musical sci-fi film (yes, I said musical science fiction) follows the forbidden love of two people that the government's marriage tribunal won't allow to marry. At least in Wile's future it sounds like people can conceive their children the fun old-fashioned messy way rather than just popping two bits into a vending machine.The entire article, published in the June 25, 1933 Oakland Tribune, appears below.1933 June 25 Oakland Tribune             While it might be somehow easier -- though still repugnant -- to understand State controlled sexual reproduction and marriage in a pre-WWII era, we must remember that human eugenics didn't die with Nazism, as you can see in this clip from 1967.

From turkey dinners to  beer to tutti-fruitti, it was a question of when we would enjoy them in pill form, not if we would. But in the October 6, 1936  Jefferson City Post-Tribune (Jefferson City, MO), Dr. Milton A. Bridges rains on the meal pill parade. The entire piece appears below.KANSAS CITY, Oct. 6 - (AP) -- Alack and alas, the hardworking housewife must give up her dream of dispensing with a four-course meal by simply feeding hubby a concentrated food pill -- it can't be done, an authority said today. The calory factor will necessitate continued operation of America's kitchens, explained Dr. Milton A. Bridges, assistant clinical professor of medicine at Columbia University and dietitics authority.\"Human beings never are going to eat pills for meals,\" said Dr. Bridges, emphatically. \"Pills can never be made to contain sufficient caloric volume.\"Caloric volume, the quantity of calories, is a factor of daily diet that must be kept to quota, Dr. Bridges explained.\"It is perfectly plausible to supply all the vitamins and minerals needed for a meal in pill form. But you can't get calories except by eating foods.\"And you'd have to eat the same foods we eat now to get those calories,\" added Dr. Bridges.These foods, if the diet is properly balance, will provide the other necessary elements at the same time, Dr. Bridges declared, making the pills just so much surplusage, as far as the normal appetite is concerned.Dr. Bridges is attending the annual fall conference of the Southwest Clinical Society.Read more:Whole Meal in Pill (1923)Food of the Future (Indiana Progress, 1896)Just Imagine (1930)That Synthetic Food of the Future (Ogden Standard-Examiner, 1926)Cigarettes of the Year 2000 (1944) ",

It gets us acquainted with the dangers of \"gerbiling.\"\"In most designs, if the driver accelerates or brakes too hard, it is possible that the force applied overcomes the force of gravity keeping the rider at the bottom of the wheel, sending the rider spinning around the inside of the wheel. This is known as gerbiling, because it has some similarity to the situation of a gerbil running too quickly inside of a hamster wheel.\"For more great monowheel pictures, (albeit none with gerbiling), check out this site.",

The accompanying illustration shows a man opening and activating theaters throughout New York state.The caption below our robot hosts reads, \"Vic Lambdin, Herald staff artist, sketches the Syracuse theater of the future, operated by robots and automations, and [receiving] its talkie programs by television from a distant master station.\"The analysis of economic forces behind the move to \"talkies\" is fascinating. And the feeling that a move to television on the big screen is inevitable is also intriguing given the fact that most people had never even seen a television set in person at that point.Much the same economic factors that forced the motion picture industry to climb on the talkie band wagon will compel the adoption of television, this may be later . . . but more likely it will be sooner.See also:Thinks We'll Do Our Reading On Screen (1923)Movie Trends of the 21st Century (1982)How Experts Think We'll Live in 2000 A.D.

        "text": "The book Meals to Come: A History of the Future of Food by Warren Belasco is one of my favorite books ever. So well researched and written, I could devote a thousand posts to its genius. Instead I'll share an insight from page 217 about the 1933 Chicago World's Fair and American attitudes at that time toward meal pills. While I think Belasco is correct in his assessment that meal pills felt inevitable for many people of that generation, it's important to remember that there were indeed skeptics.Issues of faith and control underlay much of the popular ambivalence about modernism. If, as the slogan at the 1933 Chicago fair proclaimed, \"Science Finds -- Industry Applies -- Man Conforms,\" there is not a lot that Man can do except sit back and try to enjoy the ride. The belief that modernization is both unstoppable and indifferent to individual desires probably explains the persistent popular belief in the inevitability of the meal-in-a-pill, that scary New Nutrition extrapolation. While most people vow and hope that they will never rely on pills for food, they presume future generations will conform to whatever \"science finds\" -- pills, algae, or other dystopian horrors proposed by the \"brave new world of totalitarian technics.\"I'm fascinated by trends in futurism, but I must always remind myself that people of a given generation are not of one mind. Thinking about the great number of cultural, political and social divisions present in 2010 helps to keep this in perspective. Futuristic themes we find odd today may appear to have been widely accepted in their time, but the fear of a robot uprising in the 1930s, or the inevitability of an incredibly short work week in the 1960s, or building a roof over an entire city in the 1940s, all had their fair share of skeptics. Accurately getting a feel for the acceptance of these ideas is one of the greatest challenges for historians.I'm just as interested in how many people really thought we'd have a jetpack by now as I am in why we don't have that jetpack. So if anyone has creative ways of gauging public attitudes toward these futuristic ideas of the past, I'm all ears! Well, not literally. I only have two. But will people in the year 2110 assume that the people of 2010 thought they'd all one day have three ears?

It was practically the theme of the '39 Fair that Man would adhere to the will of whatever Science and Industry dictated. An international fear of robots in the 1930s seems downright reasonable when seen through that lens.The Official Guide Book to the 1939 New York World's Fair is a beautiful, hardbound book full of paleo-futuristic delights. The introduction to the guide book appears below. I recommend listening to the official theme song of the Fair, \"Dawn of a New Day,\" while reading the intro.To the millions of Fair visitors, assembled from the many nations of the world, we bid a hearty welcome. During more than four years we have labored mightily to provide you with the great spectacle which you now see. The talents and genius of many men and women - architects, designers, artists, engineers, industrialists, businessmen, civic leaders, and educators - have been assembled to give graphic demonstration to the dream of a better \"World of Tomorrow:\" that world which you and I and our millions of fellow citizens can build from the best of the tools available to us today. We show you here in the New York World's Fair the best industrial techniques, social ideas and services, the most advanced scientific discoveries. And at the same time we convey to you the picture of the interdependence of man on man, class on class, nation on nation. We tell you of the immediate necessity of enlightened and harmonious cooperation to preserve and save the best of our modern civilization. We seek to achieve orderly progress in a world of peace; and toward this end many competent critics have already noted marked progress. The completed Fair is a living, eloquent tribute to the men and women who planned, built and operate it - to the executives and many members of a loyal and talented staff. Tribute to each and every one who worked to translate a vision into a pulsing reality.This is your Fair, built for you and dedicated to you. You will find it a never ceasing source of wonder. We feel that it will delight you and instruct you. But in the midst of all the color, and rhythm, and music and festivity you cannot fail to receive that more serious message: how you and I and all of us can actively contribute, both for ourselves and for our communities, toward that better \"World of Tomorrow\" to which we all look forward.With this brief but cordial message we present you to your Fair.See also:Our Dread of Robots (1932)Dawn of a New Day (1939)Technology and Man's Future (1972)Restaurant Robots (1931)Donald Duck's \"Modern Inventions\" (1937)All's Fair at the Fair (1938)\"I Can Whip Any Mechanical Robot\" by Jack Dempsey (1930s)Robots vs. Musicians (1931)The Robot is a Terrible Creature (1922)Gigantic Robots to Fight Our Battles (Fresno Bee, 1934)Mammy vs Robot (Charleston Gazette, 1937)Railroads on Parade (1939)Memory of 'Tomorrow' (New York Times, 1941) ",

        "text": "The September 27, 1932 Ruston Daily Leader (Ruston, Louisiana) ran a cautionary editorial about an inventor who was supposedly shot by his own robot. From the late 1920s until the late 1930s you can find countless news articles of the wondrous feats robots were supposed to have performed.The uneasy feelings we had about automation and mechanization are articulated quite well by the editorial. The end of the piece is accurate in stating, \"Machinery has created a revolution in our life. The wage-earner, the farmer, the soldier, the merchant, the politician, the schoolmaster, the printer - all of us, in every moment of our lives, live differently than our ancestors lived because of the constant increase in the mechanization of society.\"The entire editorial appears below.A fable that has held the attention of writers for more than a century came very close to coming true not long ago. An English inventor had built a big steel \"robot,\" or mechanical man, which was operated by wireless. At a word of command the robot would do various things, including fire a revolver at a target. And one day, when the inventor was just about to give the command, the robot unexpectedly raised the gun and fired, shooting the inventor in the hand.\"I always had the feeling that he would turn on me some day,\" the inventor remarked afterward. \"I don't know why he fired before I gave the signal.\"Ever since Mrs. Shelley wrote about Frankenstein, who made a mechanical man which got out of his control, this motion of an automatic, lifeless man created out of machinery has attracted writers; and the writer who handles it nearly always has his mechanical man, at last, go on a rampage and start destroying things.Indeed, fable has become the modern ghost story. We don't shudder over tales of spooks and haunts the way our fathers did, but we can always get cold chills by thinking about a steel monster that goes about with no brain or heart to control it. We find it more horrifying to think of a body without a soul than to think of a soul without a body. Furthermore, we find it easier to believe in such a thing.And now, apparently, it has happened. Life has imitated art once more. A robot has shot its master.A psychologist could probably make a good deal of this fascinating dread of ours for mechanical monsters. Machinery has created a revolution in our life. The wage-earner, the farmer, the soldier, the merchant, the politician, the schoolmaster, the printer - all of us, in every moment of our lives, live differently than our ancestors lived because of the constant increase in the mechanization of society.See also:The Mechanical Man of the Future (1928)\"I Can Whip Any Mechanical Robot\" by Jack Dempsey (1930s)Robots vs. Musicians (1931)The Robot is a Terrible Creature (1922)Gigantic Robots to Fight Our Battles (Fresno Bee, 1934)Mammy vs. Robot (Charleston Gazette, 1937)Restaurant Robots (1931)Donald Duck's \"Modern Inventions\" (1937)All's Fair at the Fair (1938) ",

        "text": " I love humanoid robots from the 1920s and 30s. They were going to fight our wars, drive our cars, and be gigolos for lonely women. In the early 1930s Westinghouse created a robot named Rastus, the \"mechanical Negro.\" And what was Rastus going to do? Nearly take an arrow to the eye, it would seem.The photo above appeared in the September 6, 1931 San Antonio Light (San Antonio, TX) and shows Samuel Montgomery Kintner playing William Tell with the robot. The photo below is from the blog Dull Tool Dim Bulb, though I'm not sure who is pictured with Rastus.Mr. S. M. Kintner, of the Westinghouse Research Laboratories, creates a mechanical Negro known as \"Rastus Robot.\" Mr. Kintner is here enacting a modern scientific version of the famous episode of William Tell, who shot the apple from his son's head. In this demonstration a flash of light is sent out from a tiny bulb concealed in the arrow, the light is picked up by an \"electric eye\" on \"Rastus,\" which ignites a charge of powder that blows the apple from the robot's head. The arrow does not leave the bow. Previously on Paleo-Future:Robots for Romantic Old Maids (1928)Have You A Little Robot?

        "text": "With every important technological innovation a vocal group of people become alarmed that their industry will be adversely effected by it. People are understandably terrified when it seems like a new technology will put them out of a job. However, throughout the twentieth century, we've seen that the people who succeed in times of transition are those able to adapt to technology rather than fight against it.Techno-reactionaries of the 1930s complained that automation and \"robots\" were going to put people out of work, and we hear identical cries today. But what is the \"robot\" of 2010? The Internet, of course!Writer Andrew Keen claims that websites like YouTube have \"infiltrated and infected\" America, putting hardworking people out of jobs by giving a voice to the amateurs rather than those who have been the traditional media gatekeepers. In Keen's 2007 book, The Cult of the Amateur, he accuses the Internet and Web 2.0 culture of crippling the entire media industry; from newspapers to recorded music. What really gets me about Keen is his moral outrage over technology and the fearmongering that goes along with it, but I'll save that for another post.Below is an ad from the Music Defense League that appeared in the November 24, 1930 Jefferson City Post-Tribune (Jefferson City, MO). The advertisement uses a robotic villian; a physical representation of the recorded or \"canned\" music that was starting to be used in theatres of the era. From the vantage point of 2010 it's a rather hilarious idea, because what is the institution of today being \"destroyed\" by new technology? Recorded music!Efficiencies in distribution brought about by the Internet mean that moving recorded music around the world is simple and inexpensive. Any scarcity in newly recorded music is artificial because you no longer have to go to a store and pay for plastic discs to enjoy the music you like. As has always been the case, the innovators will thrive and those who try to put up artificial barriers will become irrelevant and die off.Viva la technologie, etc.  Previously on Paleo-Future:Movie Theater of the Future (1930)Robots vs. Musicians (1931)A Whole World of Metal Men?

So much so, that I'm surprised they didn't give Sparko his own robo-doggie cigs.The mechanical man has been \"humanized\" in some respects and taught some of the manners of polite society. The Westinghouse robot shown in this photograph smokes cigarettes and obligingly \"gives a light\" to his companion. Another robot in Pennsylvania State College with a glass throat and water lungs puffs cigars all day long and reports scientific facts about tobacco which the most expert human smokers could not find out.

An excerpt appears below.In the first quarter of the 20th century, the developed world began an obsession with outer space. Comic-strip storyboards of domed futuristic cities and multilayered transport systems fired imaginations - and not just amongst children. Our automotive pioneers were also looking forward, working to propel the newborn car - the horseless carriage - to meet a vision. And, shape-wise, it looked bubbly.\"The globule-shaped modes of transportation come from a 1930s obsession with streamlining,\" says Matt Novak, the founder of past-future commentary site www.paleofuture.com. \"Creating streamlined modes of transportation gave the perception of efficiency and the perception that you were a part of the future was important.\"See also:What the future didn't bringNew Hampshire Public Radio (Jan, 2008)Paleo-Future in the Wall Street JournalArticle for MungBeingSincerity and the Paleo-FuturePostmodern Paleo-Future ",

In the piece, Count Sakhnoffsky proposes the alteration of humans to fit the new, fast-paced society of the future. An excerpt appears below. You can read the entire article above.Why [Count Alexis de Sakhnoffsky] asks, shouldn't men and women have their ears clipped to a torpedo raciness, get their trunks windcurved, be equipped with a set of toeless, graceful feet and possess a filtering device which will give them pure rather than germ-laden air? Not only has the count, who is to become an American citizen in a year and a half, and prefers to be called just plain Mister or, better yet, Alec, been thinking about what streamlined humans should look like. He has gone even further. He has put to paper his talented pen, from which have come designs for streamlined radios and refrigerators, and drawn concrete examples of the ideal form toward which he feels genuine moderns should be striving.See also:Bearded Men of the 21st Century (1939)Railroads on Parade (1939) ",

A century later they will only be used for shopping, picnics and the amusement of youth. They will, in fact, sink to the level now occupied by the bicycle.\"We may look forward then, it is to be supposed, to having our grandchildren tour the more out-of-the-way parts of the world and marvel at the \"quaint\" people who still chug here and there in automobiles even as we now smile at Bermuda where bicycles and horse-drawn buggies are the only forms of transportation allowed.See also:Sky Toboggan (1935)Cyclonic Rocket (circa 1930) ",

        "text": " The Official Guide Book to the 1939 New York World's Fair includes this illustration of an exhibit from the Chrysler Motors Building. The exhibit imagined the rocketport of the future and was designed by industrial designer Raymond Loewy. The text below was used for publicity purposes and can be found in the New York Public Library Digital Gallery.Focal Exhibit on Transportation in THE CHRYSLER MOTORS BUILDING at the New York World's Fair 1939.A dramatic visualization of the possibilities of swift travel over long distances by rocketship in the World of Tomorrow will be part of the Transportation Focal Exhibit in the Chrysler Motors Building at the New York World's Fair 1939. The exhibit will occupy the rotunda at the Chrysler Motors Building in the Fair's Transportation Zone.Shown in the photograph is the rocketport of the future as sketched by Raymond Loewy, industrial designer, for the intricate model which will be used in the Chrysler exhibit to demonstrate trans-ocean transport through the stratosphere by rocket. The rocketgun is pictured at the moment of its discharge; this is to be accompanied by a brilliant flash of light, a muffled explosion and ingenious effects which make it appear that the rocket vanishes in the sky-like ceiling enroute to the stratosphere, to cross the sea and reach London.As many as a thousand Fair visitors at a time will be able to watch the presentation of the rocketport with signal lights blinking, warning sirens sounding, machinery humming, while futuristic liners, trains, buses and automobiles discharge voagers. When the moment of departure nears, a crane equipped with a magnet picks up the rocketship, and, as the breech of the rocketgun opens, deposits the vehicle of the future in the gun. After an interval, the rocketgun discharges and the rocketship appears to be winging its way into the stratosphere.Before the rocketship demonstration, the story of transportation from the dawn of history to the present is told by a series of moving picture episodes flashed across the map-screen. Man is shown walking; then jeweled lights on the map indicate the distance he could travel afoot. Similar treatment shows his progress through the eras of the Viking ship, the camel, the wooden wheel, the sailing ship, and so on to the day of the airplane when the final episode portrays man circumnavigating the world in a week.

        "title": "When Wars Are Fought With Robot Soldiers (1935)",
        "text": "The idea that robot soldiers would inevitably replace human troops pops up repeatedly in newspapers of the 1930s. The emergence of humanoid robots, however primitive, lent themselves to people thinking about the human toll of the first World War and how it might be avoided in future wars.This article from the July 28, 1935 San Antonio Light (San Antonio, TX) features illustrations from artist Erik Nitsche depicting robots with machine guns for heads, robot scouts with movie camera faces, a twenty-five tube robot military band, and even a robot hospital for the repair of robot soldiers. An excerpt appears below.Erik Nitsche, a distinguished European artist, has looked into the future of a century from now and has made a series of remarkable prophetic pictures of a war fought solely with robot soldiers. The majority of them were drawn exclusively for The American Weekly and appear on this page.Instead of the human machine gunners, crouched in their emplacements, waiting for the mangling shell to end them, there is a steel encased mechanism. The most important organ to the machine gunner, without which his hands would be useless, are his eyes. Nitsche's robot machine gunner's head is the gun itself. His eyes are in the heads of those who by television and radio direct his fire. he crawls forward, his human masters miles away, striving to direct the deadly stream into the mechanical vitals of the enemy's robots.Patrol work was desperately dangerous in the last war. But a flying robot, equipped with motion picture and sound recording machines, could dart and hover over the enemy with no danger to human life -- and bring back vastly more accurate observations. When a human soldier gets a bullet in his heart, or in his liver or has himself partly blown to pieces, that is the end of that soldier. Not so with the robot. A new heart can be put in him as easily, almost, as changing a tire. Doctors were notoriously insufficient in the World War, and they found their tasks unpleasantly dangerous in the future, Mr. Nitsche thinks war robot doctors will attend to the injuries of robot soldiers. There will also be hospitals where all the equipment will be mechanical, reeking no more of blood and antiseptics but of machine oil.\t\tPreviously on Paleo-Future:Gigantic Robots To Fight Our Battles (1934)Future War Tank (1939)Will War Drive Civilization Underground?

The piece quotes heavily from electronic music pioneer Raymond Scott.CHICAGO, Aug. 27 - (AP) - Some day composers won't write music, and musicians won't play it - yet fans will enjoy it in never-before-heard perfection. The composer or artist will simply project it by brain waves - \"thought transference,\" says Raymond Scott.BRAIN WAVESThis man, who thinks in terms of electronics and music, thinks that is all quite possible. Scott said in an interview:\"Brains put out electrical waves. I wouldn't be at all surprised if some day it were possible to do away with lines in music, such as writing it out and playing the notes. You'll just be able to think it. \"Imagine fastening electrodes to your head, inviting some people to your home and then thinking your music. If you wanted 1000 violins you could have them - and if you wanted the bass fiddle to play piccolo parts, you could do that, too.\"RECORDINGS, TOO Scott says even recordings will carry, instead of musical sound, the brain waves of the composer. No arrangers, no rehearsals.Scott is a New Yorker who has spent most of his adult life working on new developments in his two loves, music and electronics. He maintains a permanent electronics research laboratory in New York, while he composes music and directs his bands for radio shows and night club appearances. His musical theories have always been off-beat.See also:Robots vs. Musicians (1931)The Future is Now (1955)How Experts Think We'll Live in 2000 A.D.

        "title": "Futuristic Products, After the War (1945)",
        "text": "American companies during World War II often stressed sacrifice in their print advertising. If we can all just be patient, they promised, we'll have more televisions and personal helicopters and push-button kitchens than you can shake a rocket car at.  After the war, the sun will power our homes.After the war, we'll have plastic skyscrapers and frozen dinners.After the war, life will be streamlined. The June 24, 1945 San Antonio Express ran an article by Associated Press science writer Frank Carey that looked at the futuristic post-war products Americans were being promised. Dissecting a Labor Department report, Carey describes what it would take, with the end of the war, for these products to see the light of day.I'm most intrigued by the article's optimistic outlook on plastics, \"...and years after the war, we may even see automobile bodies made entirely of plastics.\" However, the report acknowledges that plastic's high price doesn't make it quite yet competitive with steel. Magnesium, plywood, aluminum.. it's fascinating to look at what people of the 1940s thought the future would be built upon.Carey's entire article is below, but I'll leave you with one word about the future: plastics. Dresses made of aluminum mesh...Bathtubs made of plywood...Transparent refrigerators made of plastics...Automobiles with magnesium engine and body parts...Such visionary products of the post-war world are either in the design or experimental stage, or they're being talked about as possibilities.But the extent to which they might come into use depends upon various factors. Not the least is the dollar sign.Discussion of the post-war outlook for such war-developed materials as polastics, aluminum, magnesium, plywood and synthetic rubber, is contained in a report made by the Department of Labor's bureau of statistics to the Senate subommittee on war mobilization.The latter group, a brand of the Senate military affairs committee, described the report as \"the first comprehensive statement of wartime developments.\"The extent to which these new materials will be generally adopted is difficult to foretell,\" says the report.\"It is apparent that many of them will find larger markets than in the pre-war era period, but it is also virtually certain that not all of the facilities built during the war for the production of these materials will be needed. Comparisons of costs of various materials, which have not been of the greatest signifcance during the war, will again become important when peace returns.\"And the report adds:\"The costs of production for these newer materials will be influenced not only by purely economic factors but by many political considerations.\"Of primary importance will be the policies followed in the disposition of government-owned facilities. For some materials, notably synthetic rubber, much will depend on the policies adopted with respect to foreign trade.\"Many of the new materials will compete with each other as well as the older materials for particular uses -- for example, plastics, aluminum, magnesium, and plywood.\"The Labor Department's glance into the future was part of a comprehensive study of some 1400 technological developments made in various fields during wartime.Of plastic, this picture was given:Special qualities of plastics, such as transparency and resistance to chemical action, will fit them for varied uses in industry, the laboratory and the home. Continued use of plastics for structural parts and other articles in aircraft and automobiles is expected.And years after the war, we may even see automobile bodies made entirely of plastics.On the other hand --\"The future of the plastics industry will be governed largely by economic factors,\" says the report. \"The price per pound of most plastics remains higher than that of many materials with which plastics compete.\"Despite the fact that articles of plastics are usually lighter than those of metal and that economies may be affected in fabrication, the price differential between plastics and, for example, steel is so great as to discourage large-scale substitution.\"There nevertheless remains a multitude of applications in which plastics are highly economical, because of special properties not elsewhere attainable or because of great savings in fabrication time and costs.The report points out that the production of aluminum and magnesium expanded tremendously during wartime and says both materials may come into greater use in the future.While the annual production of magnesium before 1939 was 4,000,000 pounds, production in 1943 was 368,000,000 pounds and the nation has production capacity for much more.Indicated uses for aluminum, the report says, are for buses, automobiles, passenger ships and for the manufacture of household appliances, furniture, bicycles and burial caskets. But most uses, it adds, \"are contingent upon a suitable adjustment of the price of aluminum relative to that of stainless steel, plastics, magnesium or other competing materials.\"Desings have been prepared for automobiles with much aluminum in engine and body, \"but the large-scale application of these designs will probably have to await further development of inexpensive mass-production methods of working with the metal.\"The outlook for plywood in the post-war world \"is promising\" says the report, but it, too, will have to cope with competition.\"Among possible uses are private airplanes, lightweight box-cars, prefabricated chicken houses and automobile bodies.

        "text": "Fanciful visions of the future were few and far between in the early 1940s. This article by Sidney M. Shalett, from the April 27, 1941 New York Times sums up why.It was on a Sunday morning - the last Sunday in April - two years ago when the great World's Fair opened: April 30, 1939. In cold print the date does not seem so remote, but in two short years the rush of history, with its swift, terrible violence, has turned that brave, new World of Tomorrow into an almost forgotten legend of yesterday.Shalett goes on to explain the sense of wonder surrounding the Futurama exhibit and the speech by President Roosevelt, officially declaring the Fair open.Two years have passed. Vanished into limbo are the hectic days of 1939 and 1940. What history has done to the memory of the Fair the wrecking crews have done to the physical structure of the once-enchanted acres. Like the dinosaur, the Fair had to go, but maybe it shouldn't have gone so quickly. Today it is almost all gone: an empty, sad shell by day; an unbearably lonely graveyard by night.The author ends the piece on a note of hope.Too many memories! It is best to leave this place for a while. It will be better to return in July. Then the first units of the great Flushing Meadow Park that is to rise on the site of the Fair will be ready. Perhaps there is symbolism in that, too. Out of the wreckage of yesterday's dream of the World of Tomorrow a place of recreation, rest and beauty is being fashioned for today.The caption to the image reads:Where on April 30, 1939, throngs gathered \"for peace and freedom,\" the wrecker is today finishing his work, clearing the way for a park of tomorrow.See also:All's Fair at the Fair (1938)",

You can read more about Arnold Toynbee at Wikipedia.LONDON (UP) - Professor Arnold Toynbee, 60, one of the world's foremost historians, predicts the \"cold war\" with Russia will not become a shooting war until the year 2000 at the earliest. The author of the six-volume \"Study of History\" said the cold war probably would be fought in Asia for the next 50 years - because communism has been contained in Europe - and that a \"shooting war is not inevitable within the next 50 years.\"\"The aims of the two principal parties in the cold war, Russia and the Western powers, are better served by a cold war,\" Toynbee said. \"I would be extremely surprised if either party resorted to a shooting war.\"Toynbee said Russia had received two setbacks during the past year - Berlin and Yugoslavia.\"Both were victories for the Western powers,\" he said. \"Berlin especially so because it did not develop into a shooting war.\"See also:How Experts Think We'll Live in 2000 A.D.

Personally I see no reason to think that this is a greater danger than we have faced in the radio age. Is it worse to vote for a man whom you have seen and heard than for a man whom you have heard but never seen except for fleeting glimpses in photographs and films? Is there any more reason why a man who is good on television should be a charlatan than a man who is good on radio? Or any inherent merit in a fine radio voice uttering speeches written by somebody else?Many people ask if Abraham Lincoln could be elected today (he was an ugly, ugly man). What do you think?

        "text": "The July 16, 1943 Morning Herald (Uniontown, PA) ran this piece about the kitchen of the future, complete with built-in pots and pans. The kitchen was designed by the Libbey-Owens-Ford Glass company, which may be the same company that imagined the glass house of the year 2008.A special thanks to Warren for pointing me in the direction of these photos from Life magazine, which inspired me to track down this story. The photo featured at the top of the piece comes from the newspaper article. The rest of the photos are from Life.It's interesting to compare this vision of the future kitchen with that of 1967. Both are messages from companies wishing to sell a lifestyle of post-war consumerism as much as the products themselves, it seems.TOLEDO, O. - The \"Kitchen of Tomorrow\" that does everything but put out the cat at night now makes its debut. It eliminates pots and pans.It does away with stooping and squatting.Sore feet will be only a memory of the sad past—because in this kitchen three-quarters of the \"little woman's\" work can be done while comfortably seated.Dishwashing becomes a pleasure and burnt fingers practically impossible to acquire.And, in the vernacular—that is not the half of it!Between meal times and without the help of a magic wand the kitchen can almost instantly be transformed into a gaily-decorated play-room for the children.In the evening, it changes into a buffet bar.With a minimum of effort it converts to extra living space—with all of the familiar kitchen '\"gadgets\" and appliances buried from sight.Designed by the Libbey-Owens-Ford Glass Company to help point the way toward more practical and gracious living in the post-war era, the kitchen has an \"all this and heaven, too\" theme developed by the use of easily obtained and familiar materials worked into new shapes and forms.Sliding panels cover the sink, cooking unit and automatic food mixer, so when not in use these units become part of a long buffet—ready for use as a study bench for the children or a bar for dad.An \"out of this world\" refrigerator of glass construction has four times the capacity of today's model. Built on the principle of the cold storage locker, it is separated into compartments, each with an individual temperature control. One compartment shelf revolves—so that salads and often-used foods can be placed in it from the kitchen side and removed from the adjoining dining alcove.The oven has a sliding, heat-tempered glass hood. When the roast is revolving on the motor-driven spit mother can look at it from all angles—and without opening the oven door as of old.Most of the cooking is done in evolutionary unit one-third the size of the average stove and with built-in pots and pans which double as serving dishes.All of the kitchen equipment has been raised to an easy working level and the space ordinarily cluttered with storage bins and cabinets has been left free to provide room for the housewife's knees.Storage cabinets gain a new grace by being hung on the wall and equipped with sliding glass doors-no bumped heads!And not overlooking a thing, H. Creston Doner, designer of the kitchen, turned out a model dining alcove, as a \"running mate\" for the kitchen. He pointed out that, other than making the ideas of his department available to other designers and manufacturers, his firm's sole interest is to demonstrate some of the decorative and utilitarian advantages of glass.So that it, too, may be used for extra living space, the dining room sports a plate glass-topped table that folds back against the wall and becomes a mural-—the folding legs forming a frame to the sand-blasted design in the glass.Read more:The Future of Glass (1958)1999 A.D.

        "text": "The December 13, 1942 Montana Standard (Butte, MT) ran an interesting piece by Gardner Dane about the world of 1975,  devastated by war, forcing people to move underground in order to survive. The original article appeared in Every Week magazine. Excerpts, as well as the article in its entirety, appear below.Dane sets the stage with a vision of total ruin, a world obliterated by war:It's 1975! All hell has burst loose in World War Three! The nations of this earth have lined up again on two sides. The slaughter, devastating fury, and material damage make the wars of past history seem like children's games with toy tin soldiers! In an hour, gargantuan cities are blasted into nothingness. Desolated heaps of rubble and smoking, stinking debris mark the spot where a flock of towering skyscrapers lifted pointed peaks into the heavens.Does this mark the end of a city's existence? Does it mean the Grand Climax of civilization? The ultimate Armageddon? The wiping out of a nation as one would crush a hornet's nest?Not at all! For already the keen, dispassionate, incisive minds of scientists are fashioning the world in which many now living will be forced to exist when the next cataclysmic and catastrophic spasm of mankind occurs.Dane then goes on to put things into the context of 1942 (World War II):Historians, a thousand years hence, will write that after the victory of the Allied Nations near the middle of the twentieth century, there was an attempt to build a war-free world; but after a few years commercial rivalries sprang up again. Then the military leaders of the democracies, with the acquiescence of disillusioned millions, began preparing for the next cataclysmatic spasm of humanity.He explains what the wars of 1975 or the year 2000 would look like:There will be monstrous airplane carriers of the skies. Gargantuan dirigibles, capable of carrying a hundred fighting and bombing planes, will roam over the continents and oceans of the world. The only effective defense will be more airplanes! Yes, there will be anti-aircraft guns of power and velocity that will make today's fire power seem like toy pistols. But half a century hence giant bombers will carry cannon as powerful as today's anti-aircraft guns!The power of the atom is eerily predicted:What will happen in the twenty-first century we cannot tell. A century hence, man may have learned to use the unlimited and terrible power of the atom. He may be able to trap the rays of the sun and miraculously render obsolete the electric generator, the gasoline engine and the Diesel motor. Rocket ships may displace the motored airplanes as effectively and quickly as the automobile displaced the horse in the early part of the twentieth century.Dane then explains the preparation nations will take for war:First, when the black clouds of another war begin to gather on the horizon, nations will lay by great stores of food! Not food as we commonly think of it today, but millions upon millions of tons of dehydrated meats, fruits and vegetables! These millions of tons will be stored underground at strategic and accessible points. Scientists would probably tell us today that the problem of food for an underground civilization will be the easiest problem to solve - if we get at it soon enough. The second problem will be shelter. This will  be a gargantuan feat.Deep underground, vast chambers will have to be excavated. Families can keep together in cubicles designed for the purpose. Single men will sleep in tiers in bunks 15 or 20 high; single women will sleep in similar accommodations.All feeding will be done in central kitchens, rigidly controlled as to quality and quantity. Sanitary problems will be handled by specialists. All the accoutrements necessary for living will be moved underground. There will be hospitals and stores. Factories that produce clothes, medicines and other needs.Naturally, in an ultimate emergency such as this, everything and every last detail will be controlled by the government. The abhorred and abhorrent dictatorships of the present time will be as nothing when nations fight for their lives in the next war.The author (naturally) concludes on a pessimistic note:Prophecy is always dangerous! But if the past history and total experience of the human race has any value as a criterion of the future, within a half century there will be another war.Each war, we like to say, grows more horrible! But each war brings its defenses against the diabolical, horrible offensive weapons devised by the race of man.It seems certain that when the dogs of war are unleashed again on some future, unhappy date, civilization will have to move underground for the duration.

        "text": "I had always assumed that someone at Disney had coined the term \"Imagineering,\" until I came across an article from the May 2, 1947 Portsmouth Times (Portsmouth, Ohio) titled, \"Black Light Magic.\" The article describes the work of Arthur C. Radebaugh and the caption to the picture above uses the term \"Imagineering.\" The Wikipedia entry for Imagineering claims that the term was coined by Richard F. Sailer in a 1957 article, ten years after this article appeared. An excerpt of the Wikipedia entry appears below:The term \"Imagineering\" is a portmanteau word that combines \"imagination\" and \"engineering.\" The term was coined by Richard F. Sailer in an in-house article written for the National Carbon Company Management Magazine, and reprinted by the Union Carbide Company.

Given Chrysler's bankruptcy filing, and recent sale to Fiat, it seems appropriate that we look at what the auto industry was telling the American public about the future of cars 50 years ago.This February 9, 1958 edition of the sunday strip Closer Than We Think by Arthur Radebaugh quotes James C. Zeder, a Chrysler vice-president. Mr. Zeder predicted that in the years ahead solar-powered cars would be feasible and that the expanding knowledge of nuclear and solar energy would bring more abundant power to people everywhere. The full text of the strip appears below. As always, thanks to Tom Z. for the color version of this panel.Detroit, Feb. 7 -- The automobile industry may be producing cars driven by solar power in the years ahead, James C. Zeder, Chrysler vice-president, predicted today.\"We know how to get electrical energy from sunlight by means of silicon converters,\" said the Chrysler engineering expert. \"If we continue to increase the efficiency of these converters, and if we are able to develop small, efficient energy storage cells solar powered cars will be feasible.\"Zeder added that expanding knowledge of nuclear and solar energy is \"bringing into sight\" more abundant power for people everywhere.SUNRAY SEDANTomorrow the sunmobile may replace the automobile. The power of bottled sunshine will propel it. Your solar sedan will take energy from sunrays and store it in accumulators that work like a battery.

An excerpt appears below and you can read the entire story here.In June of 1957, the community of Tulsa buried a Plymouth Belvedere in a downtown concrete bunker beneath the Oklahoma topsoil. The car would act as the public vortex for a time capsule that would be unearthed five decades later. It would also be the grand prize in a stridently futuristic contest: During the summer of its entombment, various local citizens were given the opportunity to guess what the population of Tulsa would be in 2007. Whoever was closest (and was, presumably, still alive) would win the (now classic) car, along with several gallons of gasoline and oil. It appears that people in 1957 weren't positive that gas and oil would still be in use half a century later. This is how optimistic Americans used to be: We used to imagine that cars of the future would probably run on uranium, potato peels, and distilled water.See also:Tulsa Time Capsule (1957) ",

But tomorrow's vacationers will be able to do far better. Pools in transparent structures above the ground will enable observers to relax alongside and have the fun watching underwater aquatic frolicking at the same time.This in-the-air pool for swimming in the future is shaped like a cocktail glass or the bottom half of a fish bowl.

Experts are already studying the problems involved in creating the population centers that will be necessary for tapping the hidden-wealth of the area and building the defense outposts that may be required.One possibility would be to construct arctic cities under great domes of transparent plastic or glass, where springlike temperatures could be maintained. Such domes are already in use at the Glasgow Central Station in Scotland and at a big downtown plaza in Sao Paulo, Brazil.How would isolated polar cities, ringed by icebergs and mountains, be supplied? Our armed forces have a solution - the dirigible. Recently, the Navy told how its blimp ZPG-2 successfully flew food and other supplies to an ice island team of scientists only 500 miles from the North Pole.See also:Closer Than We Think!

Mass production of low-cost plastic hulls will be made possible by the use of guns that spray the plastic, similar to the \"Fiber-Resin Depositor\" as conceived by the Rand Development Corporation.The family car will be used for motive power. When the yachtsman of the future drives his auto into the cradle of his new marine creation the engine will be in place. The rear wheels will rest on a roller linked to the propeller. The driver will put the car in gear, step on the accelerator, and presto - he'll be yachting.See also:Closer Than We Think! (1958-1963)Amphibian Monorail (Popular Science, 1934)",

Instead, employ a robot - to cook, set the table, clear it off, wash the dishes and put them away.A firm of industrial designers, Sundberg, Ferar, Inc., has already projected an idea for such a \"mechanical maid.\" A self-propelled serving cart would move linen, glasses, china and silver to the table.

The modular/mobile nature of the whole idea is reminiscent of the \"farm to market\" trains featured in Magic Highway, U.S.A. They certainly could have inspired the \"mobile malls\" of 1981 we looked at a while back.Here's an idea to make marketing faster and easier! As proposed by the Clark Equipment Company of Battle Creek, Michigan, it involves the use of self-service \"food banks\" that would be preloaded with bread, milk, soups, etc., at the wholesaler's and then hauled to handy neighborhood locations for the convenience of retail shoppers.The idea might be further developed to enable the housewife to drive around an oval arrangement of such preloaded display sections and pick out what was needed. A clerk would put the desired groceries on a moving belt which would move when the auto did, so that the purchases would wind up at the checkout counter at the same time the driver did. They'd be packaged and paid for - all with the customer still seated at her wheel.Thanks to Tom Z. for this color edition of Closer Than We Think.Previously on Paleo-Future:Farm to Market (1958)Closer Than We Think (1958-1963)Disney's Magic Highway, U.S.A.

As father chooses the route in advance on a push-button selector, electronics take over complete control. Progress can be accurately checked on a synchronized scanning map. With no driving responsibility, the family relaxes together. En route business conferences are conducted by television. I really wish that Disney would release this as part of their Walt Disney Treasures collection. (Maybe an entire DVD devoted to Disney paleo-futurism?) Better yet, they could offer every Disneyland program on iTunes or use an advertising-based model. I know that Disney likes to make their offerings scarce through limited release DVDs, but the free flow of information just breeds piracy if \"legitimate\" copies aren't made available.I'll get off my soapbox now.

Except for one little thing... we're still waiting on those driverless cars. The futuristic family from this ad bares a striking resemblance to the family of Disneyland TV's 1958 episode, \"Magic Highway, USA.\"ELECTRICITY MAY BE THE DRIVER. One day your car may speed along an electric super-highway, its speed and steering automatically controlled by electronic devices embedded in the road. Highways will be made safe -- by electricity! No traffic jam.. no collisions... no driver fatigue.I'm certainly no expert on energy politics of the 1950's, but I must say that the ad takes a weird turn when it starts explaining that power companies are so great because they don't have to wait for an act of Congress to get things done. Can anyone explain the subtleties of the dynamic at work here? Was it merely Cold War chest-pounding about free enterprise or was there a threat to nationalize American power companies around this time? Your air conditioner, television and other appliances are just the beginning of a new electric age.Your food will cook in seconds instead of hours. Electricity will close your windows at the first drop of rain. Lamps will cut on and off automatically to fit the lighting needs in your rooms. Television \"screens\" will hang on the walls. An electric heat pump will use outside air to cool your house in the summer, heat it in the winter.You will need and have much more electricity than you have today. Right now America's more than 400 independent electric light and power companies are planning and building to have twice as much electricity for you by 1967. These companies can have this power ready when you need it because they don't have to wait for an act of Congress -- or for a cent of tax money -- to build the plants.The same experience, imagination and enterprise that electrified the nation in a single lifetime are at work shaping your electric future. That's why in the years to come, as in the past, you will benefit most when you are served by independent companies like the ones bringing you this message -- America's Indpendent Electric Light and Power Companies.

They pump air out of a room, so it is like space. Men who are inside wear space suits to test them. The men breathe through a hose connected to an oxygen tank.Next a man may test a space suit in a three-stage rocket. Perhaps he will pilot stage three after it breaks away and speeds into space. He will go too fast to feel the pull of gravity. His body will lose all its weight. He will float around the cabin, if he isn't strapped in place. Will the first space traveler like the ride? When he lands, he will tell us.Other men will follow the first space traveler into space. They will test bigger and bigger rockets. And so scientists will learn how to build great big rocket ships. These ships will fly around the world in an hour.In time, scientists will know how to build rocket ships that can carry people to the moon. After the moon, what next?

Speculation that Mars might have animal life is contained in a book, \"A Space Traveler's Guide to Mars,\" by Dr. I. M.

One bit of evidence is changes in blue-green areas, which could be plant life spreading with the seasons over the Martian deserts.And if there are plants, are there animals that feed on them and help decompose dead plants?See also:Animal Life on Mars (1957)Plant Life on Mars (1957)Mars and Beyond (1957) ",

        "text": "The Independent Press-Telegram magazine, Southland (Long Beach, CA) dedicated their entire November 4, 1956 issue to \"You and the Year 2000.\" The section about farming appears below.The most odd scenario depicted is one in which an H-bomb actually makes crops grow better. The entire article by George Serviss, entitled \"Anyone for a Garchidrose?\" appears below.Farmer Jones stepped to a small black instrument panel at the rear of the air-conditioned plastic \"bubble\" in which we sat, my wife seated beside me - I had brought her along to write the woman's angle of this interview with a Year 2000 farm family for \"Atomic Life.\" We had just come up a ray-powered elevator from the family's spacious bomb-and-fungus-proofed, solar-conditioned subsurface quarters. We were surveying his fields. Farmer Jones pressed a button marked \"Activator.\" There was a slight hum and a cylinder rose in the field a few feet beyond the clear plastic wall. A door opened in the cylinder and a robot, closely resembling a 1956 man, stepped jerkily out into the field.\"I must apologize for my hired hand,\" Farmer Jones said lightly, \"Since full parity prices have been removed from our crops, I haven't been able to afford a newer model. But, he has served me well. A couple of new tubes and a paint job will tide him over for another year or two.\"Farmer Jones was now operating a small lever that projected from a squarish box that stood up from the floor. The lever seemed to swing around a 360-degree circle and, as I watched, I could see that this was the control for the robot. I turned back to the field to watch development. I'd already asked about the quality of his crops.The robot moved swiftly now, under Farmer Jones' guidance. \"Carrot, perhaps?\" queried Farmer Jones. \"Or a turnip; perhaps a tomato?\" he asked, turning the robot this way and that in the rows that could be seen beyond the plastic. There was very little foliage to mark the rows, produce being grown these days for the edible roots and fruits with a minimum of green waste. Chlorophyll derivative sprays replaced greenery, as I had already observed in my extensive farm and garden writings.Perhaps we should have a leaf or two of spinach, too,\" Farmer Jones commented, steering the robot on another course to a green section of the field into which the machine almost totally disappeared, so tall was the vegetation.\"I'll bring the man in now,\" Farmer Jones said, and guided the robot to a belt conveyor box which projected beyond the bubble. \"Haven't been out in the fields since we were H-bombed in the last war,\" he said. He laughed ruefully, \"Don't think it would be healthy,\" he said, \"still 'hot'; but you'd be surprised what that bombing did for the soil. Things grow like crazy; and the robot doesn't mind a bit sowing the seeds and keeping the place up.\"The impromptu harvest came tumbling into the bubble - through a radiation trap. Farmer Jones explained. \"They're safe to handle now,\" he said, and pressed a \"Deactivator\" button that left the robot hired-hand standing at attention. The humming stopped.The vegetable were all that Farmer Jones had previously boasted that they would be. Carrots three feet long. I took a sample nibble of one; cleaned and completely sanitized by passing through the radiation trap. It was delicious. So was the turnip, four feet in diameter and as tender as butter. I carved a chunk with my electronic pocket incisor and passed it to my wife who has always had a penchant for raw vegetables. She exclaimed with delight at its flavor.The giant tomato, fully as large as a regulation basketball, gushed red juice of tantalizing aroma when I pricked the skin with my incisor.The spinach leaves were far larger than palm fronds, but I have persisted in a childhood aversion for this delicacy. I merely examined the leaves for texture.\"No sand,\" commented Farmer Jones,\" and the flavor is very similar to lemon squash. All the old-time vitamins, though.\"We chatted on crop prospects and the market outlook while Farmer Jones sent his man after a handful of cherries, which were chilled by dry ice in the hands of the robot before they reached us. One apiece was more than enough Farmer Jones asked:\"Would your wife like to have a nice, fresh corsage? I've something new I've just perfected.\"He dispatched the robot on another guided errand. The corsage that was deposited on the conveyor belt was, indeed, \"something new.\"\"I call it 'garchidrose',\" Farmer Jones said. \"I've combined gardenia, orchid and rose in one, together with fern, to grow a complete, multiple-flower corsage on one plant. It does need a bit of ribbon,\" he apologized, \"but I haven't found the way to grow the ribbon yet!\" My wife was delighted.We turned to leave.\"By the way,\" I said. \"These vegetables of yours; they must be very high in vitamin content.\"\"They are, they are,\" he said. \"Extremely so.\"\"They you must be a very healthy man,\" I said.\"Me? Oh no; I never eat them. No roughage for me. I have ulcers. I'm strictly a cottage cheese and pill man, myself.\"See also:Closer Than We Think!

        "text": "Andrew A. Kucher [right] with Anastas I. Mikoyan [left] (Life Magazine, 1959)In 1958 you'd find no greater advocate for the hovercar than Ford vice president Andrew A. Kucher. Kucher was on a media blitz in the late 50s and early 60s, being quoted in the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Mechanix Illustrated, Chicago Daily Tribune, Popular Mechanics, Automotive Fleet and below in Arthur Radebaugh's syndicated Sunday comic, Closer Than We Think.Kucher is credited with having conceived the idea of the hovertrain in the 1930s, a precursor to today's Maglev trains which use magnets rather than compressed air to achieve a similar effect. Newspapers from April, 1958 describe a three foot long hovercar model that was shown to reporters in Detroit. Riding on a cushion of air, Kucher described how this \"Glideair\" car could one day achieve 200-500 miles per hour since it didn't have tires which burn up and lose traction or control. An Associated Press piece even quotes Kucher as saying that such technology would be in use in the \"foreseeable future.\"For the love of Hugo! If God had intended that we fly he would've attached propellors to our feet! Amirite? Amirite?!!?!?!Look, pa, no wheels! Use of a thin layer of compressed air may allow autos to hover and move just above ground level.A pipe dream? Not at all. The concept (already proved) comes from scientist Andrew Kucher, vice-president of engineering at one of our major motor companies. His people are studying how to maintain stability. Special highway engineering is one way. Another is skillful design, evidenced already in experimental ideas from the staff of motor stylist George W. Walker.Today's earthbound cars won't turn into low flying carpets right away. But it may happen sooner than we think! As always, thanks to Tom Z. for the color scan of this panel from April 6, 1958.

Though the strip often ran on Sunday, the more eagle-eyed amongst you (read: nerdy) may notice that this particular strip was published in the Toronto Star Weekly on Saturday, May 2, 1959. Before alternative energy policy became a political wedge issue, techno-utopians like Radebaugh promoted renewable energy as sleek and sexy. Solar energy was supposed to power our cars, drive our space colonies and make deserts bloom. As we enter into a new era of optimism --driven by the New Optimists, if you will-- it seems that \"the future\" just might become less politicized and more dependent upon the scientific, the dynamic and the rational.But then again, maybe I'm just an optimist.Don't be surprised if many of tomorrow's homes are built on turntables. They would slowly pivot all day long to receive maximum benefit from health-giving sun ray and insure heat in winter.This warm and colorful year-round design is adapted from an aluminum firm's summer house which has been studied and admired by architects.

However, the topic first sparked my interest when I visited Walt Disney World's EPCOT Center, (now Epcot), and realized that Disney's version of the future was based upon what they thought the future would look like in the 1980s. As is important when depicting the future, your opinions must change with the times, unless you happen to be omnipotent, which means you have no need to revise your vision of the future and have probably used your powers for such noble endeavors as guessing my weight at the local carnival or writing horoscopes that tell me, \"you should find time for yourself tonight.\"  While I might poke fun at the outlandish ideas of 1950s America, corporate puffery, or Jules Verne I do it with an admiration for the idealism we seem to be losing in our post-modern society.  The belief that technology has the potential to improve the lives of everyone on Earth seems rare.  Just remember that an optimism for the future and the attempt to better the world for all humanity is hidden somewhere within each sarcastic comment about flying cars and space farms. In that same vein, I will always remember that the dystopian societies depicted by George Orwell or Alan Moore are just as plausible if we surrender freedom in the name of security.

According to Wikipedia, (the only source for anything that my generation might care about) this was not a new idea. Joseph Strauss, designer of the Golden Gate Bridge, proposed something similar for railroads in the 1890s.Sen. Magnuson of Washington has a bold new idea for linking our newest state, Alaska, with Siberia via a bridge or vehicular tunnel across the 30- to 40-mile stretch of shallow waters of the Bering Strait. It would go from Wales, on the tip of Seward Peninsula, to Little Diomede and Big Diomede Islands, thence to Peyak, Siberia.The Senator forecasts this hook-up within the lifetime of the present generation, to create a rail and highway route between points as distant as New York and Paris. \"I am convinced,\" he says, \"that the tourists who one day will drive this route will be our best ambassadors!\"Next week: Plastic SchoolhousesPreviously on Paleo-Future:How Experts Think We'll Live in 2000 A.D.

Something very similar to this appears in the May 14, 1958 Disneyland TV episode Magic Highway, U.S.A..Tomorrow's turnpikes will \"flow\" out of giant machines like magic ribbons across the countryside. The basic equipment is already in existence; only a few improvements are needed.The forward section of such a road-builder would be a variant of the new jungle-smashing LeTourneau \"tree-crusher\" combined with a grader. The middle section would pour concrete in a never-ending flow, with the rear portion leveling the still soft pavement. A line of freight helicopters would be on hand to feed the behemoth with the material necessary to keep it moving across any type of country.See also:Disney's Magic Highway, U.S.A.

So we may find that some of tomorrow's hospitals may actually be anchored in the heavens.One of these hospitals might be shaped like a disc atop elevator tubes leading to the control section. The mushroom-like disc would contain weightless operating rooms for treating heart and other organic troubles as well as bone diseases. It would also serve as a nucleus for crystal balls which, orbiting slowly, would utilize concentrated sunrays to treat cancer, skin diseases and similar ailments. There would also be experimental areas for the study of low temperature therapy -- a challenging new field for medical investigation.As always, thanks to Tom Z. for the full-color version of this Radebaugh panel.Previously on Paleo-Future:Medical Predictions for 1995 (1955)Bloodless Surgery, Closer Than We Think!

The house was an exercise in futurist design, built of pre-fabricated plastic. The Smithsons admired the manufacturing methods of the American auto industry. The mass production-based industries had already revolutionized half the house - the kitchen, bathroom, laundry room and garage. The architects advocated using factory-built, fitted kitchen units which could be easily updated. The House of the Future took the concept of flexibility beyond conventional open plan with only the kitchen and bathroom modules differentiated from the rest. An electrostatic dust collector was provided and cooking utensils incorporated their own heating elements. It was ideas such as these that impressed visitors to the exhibition rather than the building itself, with no external windows.See also:1999 A.D.

        "text": "The December 27, 1950 Robesonian (Lumberton, NC) ran an Associated Press article titled, \"How Experts Think We'll Live in 2000 A.D.\" The article covered the future of movies, commercial flight, space travel, medicine and women, among many other topics. Can you believe that by the year 2000 a woman may be president of the United States? Apparently not.Some highlighted predictions of the piece appear below. A transcribed version of the article in its entirety can be found on my other blog, Older Than Me.- Third dimensional color television will be so commonplace and so simplified at the dawn of the 21st century that a small device will project pictures on the living room wall so realistic they will  seem to be alive. The room will automatically be filled with the aroma of the flower garden being shown on the screen.- The woman of the year 2000 will be an outsize Diana, anthropologists and beauty experts predict. She will be more than six feet tall, wear a size 11 shoe, have shoulders like a wrestler and muscles like a truck driver. She will go in for all kinds of sports – probably will compete with men athletes in football, baseball, prizefighting and wrestling.- Wireless transmission of electric power, long a dream of the engineer, will have come into being. There will be no more power lines to break in storms. A simple small antenna on the roof will pick up the current for lighting a house.- The Third World War - barring such a miracle as has never yet occurred in relations between countries so greatly at odds - will grow out of Russia's exactly opposite attempts to unify the world by force.- The telephone will be transformed from wire to radio and will be equipped with the visuality of television. Who’s on the other end of the line will seldom be a mystery. Evey pedestrian will have his own walking telephone – an apparatus by a combination of the X-ray and television. Electronic appendectomies will be performed with an X-ray-TV camera, projection screen and electric “knives” – the latter actually being electrodes functioning without puncturing the skin.- In 2000 we shall be able to fly around the world in a day. We shall be neighbors of everyone else on earth, to whom we wish to be neighborly.- The nation's industrial and agricultural plant will be able to support 300 million persons 50 years from now - twice the present population. Land now unproductive will be made to yield. Science will steadily increase crop production per acre. Technological, industrial and economic advances will give the American people living standards eight times as high as now.- Public health will improve, especially the knowledge of how air carries infections, like the common cold, from person to person. Before 2000, the air probably will be made as safe from disease-spreading as water and food were during the first half of this century.- Space platforms, sent out from earth, will end mid-century’s “iron curtain” era by bringing the entire globe under constant surveillance.- Combination automobile-planes will have been perfected.- People will live in houses so automatic that push-buttons will be replaced by fingertip and even voice controls. Some people today can push a button to close a window – another to start coffee in the kitchen. Tomorrow such chores will be done by the warmth of your fingertip, as elevators are summoned now in some of the newest office buildings – or by a mere whisper in the intercom phone.- Radio broadcasting will have disappeared, for no one will tune in a program that cannot be seen. Radio will long since have reverted to a strictly communications medium, using devices now unheard of and unthought of.- Some movie theaters of A.D. 2000 may be dome-shaped, with ceiling and walls arching together like the sky. These surfaces would be the “screen.” Most action would still be in front of you, as now. But some could be overhead, some at the sides, and some even on the wall behind. A little girl steps into a street in the action before you – and you turn around and look behind you to see if an auto is coming.- Through the extended use of better plants and animals, improved fertilizers, new growth regulators and more efficient machinery, it should be possible, leaders say, for farmers to produce future crop needs on much less land than today.- Some see us drifting toward the all-powerful state, lulled by the sweet sound of “security.” Some see a need to curb our freedom lest it be used to shield those who plot against us. And some fear our freedom will be hard to save if a general war should come.- So tell your children not to be surprised if the year 2000 finds 35 or even a 20-hour work week fixed by law.The piece was written by the following specialists of The Associated Press: J.M.

        "text": "I had to buy stamps recently. It was the worst.Nothing pushes me into full curmudgeon hack mode quite like standing in line at the post office. We're talking Andy Rooney/ Dave Barry lovechild super-curmudgeon. And don't even get me started on FedEx. Standing in line is so 20th century.That being said, there's something charming about our antiquated postal service. People literally take letters and packages from one physical place and deliver them to another place. It's pretty darn cute.In 1960 the future of electronic mail was still envisioned as an analog experiment. Arthur Radebaugh's Closer Than We Think ran a panel on December 25, 1960 in which physical letters would be opened, scanned, beamed to space, returned to earth and reproduced where they would then be delivered to their final destination in the form of a small capsule. It was difficult for people to imagine a world without the postal service delivering some form of physical media, dead tree or otherwise.The October 4, 1958 edition of Radebaugh's syndicated strip imagined jetpack mailmen of the future leaping from door to door in Suburbatopia, U.S.A. The strip explains that because of its super-secret government technology they can't go into detail on how such a rocket pack might work, but rest assured, it'll make every mail carrier in town a regular Buck Rogers.Uncle Sam's mailmen can look forward to going faster, getting farther, and doing so with less effort than ever before. All it will take will be a device like the recently prefected \"rocket assists\" which were originally developed to help infantrymen leap like grasshoppers.Just how such equipment works is still a military secret. The designer, Reaction Motors, Inc., is not permitted to say how large the device is, or how long it fires, or what kind of fuel it uses. But best guess is that the rocket fires intermittently, so that the wearer can bound from spot to spot as he wishes, with no more energy then it takes to walk. Also the mechanism is believed to be of small size, simply constructed and low-priced. What a boon for mailmen and others whose work takes them from door to door! Many thanks to Tom Z. for the color version of this amazing panel from Closer Than We Think!",

The entire article appears below.HOLLYWOOD (A.P.) -- Fifty years from now, a woman of 50 will be just as alluring as a girl of 20. That is the fearless prediction of Max Factor, head of the cosmetics concern that is celebrating its first half-century.\"When my father started the company in 1909, women scarcely used cosmetics at all,\" he commented. \"They pinched their cheeks to give them color. The only ones who painted their lips were women of questionable repute or theatrical types - and there was little distinction between the two.\"The movie stars helped us spread the use of makeup. As the stars became popular, the public copied their dress and grooming.\"Gradually, the use of makeup became almost universal among women. Now girls start wearing it at 14 or younger instead of waiting until they are 18.\"What about 50 years hence?\"People will be living longer. When we started in business, the life expectancy was 40 years or so. Now it is in the 70s and it will go higher. People will want to avoid the lines and sags of old age as long as possible.\"I firmly believe that in the future women of 50 years or more will look as appealing as girls of 20. We are keeping in touch with scientific experiments in Europe on youth-giving cosmetics.\"Factor also foresees the extensive use of cosmetics by men 50 years from now, and for the same reason; to keep young. Men who live longer will want to work longer; hence they'll need to avoid looking aged. Among the Factor predictions: A pill which will forestall the graying of hair.See also:Champion Paper: Protecting You From The Tyrannical Future Government (Newsweek, 1979)1999 A.D.

Thus the stadium would be as suitable for a baseball game as it would be for football, boxing or hockey.And not only would such a stadium bring spectators right up to where the action took place - but as an added touch there might be an adjustable mobile glass roof to protect them from the elements.Next week: \"Turnpike Jet Lines\"Many thanks to Tom Zmudzinski for providing this difficult to find strip.See also:Sports Fans of the Year 2000 (1967)Mile Run in 3:41 by Year 2000 (1965)Lunar High Jump (1979)Sport in Space Colonies (1977)Olympic Games on the Moon in 2020 (1979)Zero-Gravity Football (1981)Future Without Football (Daily Review, 1976)\"Grasshopper\" Golf Cart (1961)",

        "text": "Dr. Lowry H. McDaniel of Tyronza, Ark., was a very optimistic doctor, though his ideas were certainly in line with medical futurists' thinking of that era. The June 9, 1955 Charleston Gazette (Charleston, WV) lays out his vision of the year 1999, which includes a 150 year life span, a cancer vaccine, and the complete eradication of infectious disease. You can read his 10 predictions for the year 1999 below:A man 90 years old will be considered \"young,\" a man of 135 \"more mature\" and there will be \"a minimum of senility because the heavy cholesterol which determines the age of our arteries will be absent.\"\"Our women, thanks to proper hormone medication, would stay young, beautiful and shapely indefinitely.\"The Salk killed-virus vaccine \"which is doing a tremendous job now\" will be replaced in a few years by a living modified virus vaccine.All human infectious disease, including rheumatic heart disease and venereal disease, will be eradicated.Cancer will be \"successfully treated by a virus vaccine or radioactive compounds.\"The common cold and \"even the more serious respiratory virus infections will be only a memory.\"\"Even greater victories await the highly-trained surgeon\" of the future. Eye surgeons will restore vision to today's hopeless cases.Synthetic foodstuff will bring an end forever to famine and starvation.Electronic devices will enable deaf mutes to \"speak.\" Initial research is underway by the Radio Corporation of America.Insulin will be given in tablet form for the control of diabetes. Medical science will discover an \"effective treatment\" against the blood, heart and degenerative diseases of old age. Previously on Paleo-Future:Bloodless Surgery, Closer Than We Think!

        "text": "I'd like you to imagine a crazy, futuristic dystopia in which women (gasp) work outside the home. And I'm not talking about doing a little gardening on the weekends. I mean full-fledged, testosterone-driven, trouser-wrenching, tell Little Johnny I'll be late for his baseball game, kind of  jobs.What's that you ask, \"But if women get jobs outside the home, who will sew on all the buttons?\" Good question. Read on.The August 17, 1959 San Antonio Light (San Antonio, TX) ran a column by Douglass Welch titled, \"Nirvana Draws Nearer.\" The part of Welch's column pertaining to women appears below.There is an industrial designer in Detroit named Montgomery Ferar (he should have stood in bed), who has taken a long look into the near future and thinks he knows what the American woman is going to be like. If he's right, she is going to be sitting on a silken pillow all day long, curling her hair, buffing her nails and thinking up ways to beguile a husband who won't need her any more.Mr. Ferar says we are \"squandering\" our American woman today on \"dull repetitive tasks in the home and office,\" and, although we are tempted to say that a little judicious squandering never hurt any woman, we won't. He says he is going to free the American woman from housework so she can devote her \"perseverence, manual dexterity and meticulous attention to detail to creative ends.\" Mind you, he doesn't say she has brains; He thinks of her only as having certain mechanical skills.We don't like the kind of woman he visualizes. We would be late almost every night coming home to such a woman. In the future, Mr. Ferar says, the kitchen will disappear. Our woman will be sitting at the family table dressed to the teeth like a sultry adventuress while robot, self-energized utensils whip up the family dinner and serve it. After dinner the dishes \"will be loaded,\" presumably by the husband and children, into a \"dining caddy\" or combination dishwasher and storage cabinet, which will roll off into another room, washing the dishes on the way.NO MORE CLEANINGThe cleaning and dusting of a home will be made unnecessary by electronic filters built into the air conditioning system, and beds won't have to be made because there will be no sheets, blankets and pillowcases. Radiant ceiling panels will keep us warm by beddy-bye. And at the supermarket our woman will merely shout her orders into a machine which will collect and pack her purchases and thank her kindly.Mr. Ferar thinks this will free the American woman for a career. It means no such thing. At best it means that instead of spending half her waking moments chasing her children and attending to them and keeping them out of danger she would only be freed to spend ALL her time doing that.Come, Mr. Ferar, let's think this thing through. You still haven't found a way to sew on buttons and send suits out to the cleaner and do the family bookkeeping and wipe away tears.See also:Max Factor on the Woman of 2009 (1959)Taller Women by Year 2000 (1949)Closer Than We Think!

The final section of the book focuses on these wishes with that special blend of sincerity and hope the 1950s is best known for.The wishes are shown below along with some of the accompanying illustrations. To read the prologue of the book you can check out \"the other blog.\"OUR FIRST WISH: POWERThe coal and oil resources of our planet are dwindling, yet we need more and more power. The atomic Genie offers us an almost endless source of energy. For the growth of our civilization, therefore, our first wish shall be for: POWER! OUR SECOND WISH: FOOD AND HEALTHMankind has long suffered from hunger and disease. The atomic Genie offers us a source of beneficial rays. These are magic tools of research which can, above all, help us to produce more food for the world and to promote the health of mankind. Our second wish, therefore, shall be for: FOOD AND HEALTH! OUR THIRD WISH: PEACEThere is left to us the third and last wish. It is an important one that demands wisdom. If the last wish is unwise, then - as some of the legends tell - all the wishes granted before may be lost. See also:Atomic Power Plant of the Future (1939)Closer Than We Think!

An electromagnetic gun would emit rays that would instantly \"repaint\" the car in any desired hue or combination -- perhaps to harmonize with milady's new fall outfit.D. S.

I travel the United States often imagining what the downtowns of our major cities once looked like. Few American downtowns are thriving, or barely surviving. The downtown of the city in which I live (St. Paul, MN) is certainly struggling. Good luck finding much open past 5PM.Radebaugh's mention of downtown Detroit is particularly jarring for our 2009 eyes. The recent photo essay in Time magazine titled, \"The Remains of Detroit\" really says it all. I recently picked up the book Downtown: Its Rise and Fall, 1880-1950, which appears to shed some light on precisely what happened to the American urban center.The text from \"Rejuvenated Downtowns\" appears below. Thanks again to Tom Z. for the color scans.Traffic-choked downtown sections will be rejuvenated and transformed into airy, wide pedestrian malls when the designs of city planners are adopted in a none-too-distant future. Large-scale plans and programs are springing up all over the country. One example is fashionable Lincoln Road in Miami Beach, being studied today for conversion into a traffic-free shopping promenade. Another is utilitarian Woodward Avenue in downtown Detroit. There are many more in between.Traffic will be parked in adjoining areas. Store fronts will be modernized and beautified. New lighting at night and newly planted trees, shrubs and flowers will give these malls an exciting air. The aim is to regain for downtowns their former status as urban headquarters.Next week: All-Seeing EyePreviously on Paleo-Future:California Cities in the Year 2000 (1961)Closer Than We Think!

The flying platforms shown here would be suitable for such uses as low altitude hops to neighboring shops. Military models of these \"hoppers\" have already been developed at Piasecki Aircraft and Chrysler. The flat platforms are lifted by air blasts through ducts at the bottom. The vanes of the ducts are movable, to permit control of direction. These vehicles would hover like helicopters and move at city traffic speeds. Construction would be simple, and costs could be kept low enough for civilian requirements.Next Week: Farm RainmakersSee also:Online Shopping (1967)GM's Shopping Cart Car (1964) ",

Below is an excerpt from chapter nine titled, \"We Hitch Up the Sun.\"The sun rose as usual on January 10, 1999, and went to work.In a great, sun-drenched desert, a thousand acres of collector plates soaked up the sun's heat, intensified it and relayed it to boilers. This was the energy source for an electric power plant that operated a great sea-water purification works a few miles away. The sea water irrigated the desert.In a field, winding rows of plastic-topped trenches soaked the sun's light into a deep green liquid that turned thicker almost as you watched. This was an algae farm using the sun's energy to grow food.On millions of roof tops, glass collectors absorbed sun heat, to be stored in tanks. These were home-heating plants without other fuel. The world of 1999 had begun to tap the greatest energy source, the daily rays of the sun, and with this golden treasure was lighting cities and making deserts bloom, milking cows and baking sunshine cakes.See also:Solar Energy for Tomorrow's World (1980)Delicious Waste Liquids of the Future (1982)Sea City 2000 (1979)",

        "text": "The Smithsonian has an online exhibit which includes these lunch boxes from the late 1950s and early 1960s. The satellite lunch box from 1958 shows a torodial space station, which is featured prominently in the short film Challenge of Outer Space. Excerpts from the Smithsonian website appear below each picture.Satellite Lunch Box (1958)The Soviet launch of the Sputnik satellite in late 1957 sparked interest in the United States in science education even among elementary school children. In 1958, King Seeley Thermos produced this imaginative box evoking space travel and landings on distant moons and planets. Children provided a receptive audience to this imaginary yet hopeful view of scientific achievement in the early years of the space race. This is one of the few pop culture lunch boxes from the late 1950s not designed around a television show.Jetsons Lunch Box (1963)Aladdin Industries profited from the success of The Jetsons television cartoon series in the fall of 1963 by introducing a domed lunch box featuring that space-traveling suburban family and their robotic maid. American notions of family life in the 1960s traveled effortlessly outward to interplanetary space on this fanciful box.Domed metal lunch boxes traditionally were carried by factory employees and construction workers, but Aladdin and other makers found the curved shape made an excellent young person's landscape, ocean scene, or starry sky. Despite the more earth-bound adult concerns of the Cuban missile crisis of 1962 and the Kennedy assassination, The Jetsons box and bottle showcase the metal lunch box at the zenith of its design life and its popularity among school children.(Found in yesterday's USA Today)See also:Challenge of Outer Space (circa 1950s)The Complete Book of Space Travel (1956)Mars and Beyond (1957)Man and the Moon (1955)",

        "text": "The classic 1956 book The Complete Book of Space Travel contains some amazing imagery. The book was targeted at young boys and had that unique blend of sincerity, wonder and confidence we so often see in 1950s futurism. As early as 1956 the question was not if we'd explore the moon and other planets in our solar system, but when we would make this a reality. Chapter 22 is even titled, \"If We Are Visited First.\"Below is the introduction to the book as well as an illustration from the title page. Stay tuned as we look deeper into this paleo-futuristic classic in the coming weeks.The first space pilot has already been born. He is probably between ten and sixteen years of age at this moment. Without doubt both he and his parents listen to radio and television programs dealing with much space adventure but with few accurate facts. This book is designed to outline the facts of space travel, and the conditions we expect to find in space and among the planets and stars. These facts alone are sufficiently exciting, since they are factors in man's greatest single adventure - the exploration of the universe.This book has not been written for the space pilot alone. It is written for his engineer, his astrogator, the vast grounds crews who will design the ship, and the many people whose taxes and investments will make it vital to understand the problems and progress of space travel.Space travel is already here. Flying saucers are probably indicative of space travel by a race other than ours. We are slowly solving the problems of man's own survival in space. It is only a matter of a few years, and many, many dollars, before our first space pilot will launch himself into the last frontier of exploration, adventure, and commerce.We read much about space stations, the small man-made satellites which will be designed to circle the earth at an altitude of several thousand miles. Actually, these space stations will be very useful, even if space travel never develops any further, and we should know about them too.Although much has been written about space travel, much of this material deals with the mechanics of ship construction to get us into space.It is the purpose of this book, on the other hand, to show that space travel is also a biological problem, even perhaps to a greater extent than it is an engineering problem. Moreover it is the purpose of this book to describe, to the best of present knowledge, what we expect to encounter when we get to space. This is important, because the success of man's greatest adventure will depend upon being well prepared.Today, space travel is one of the ultimate goals of scientific and military research. The familiar cry, \"Who rules the moon controls the earth!\" reflects our readiness to exploit space. Our military might is ready for space; our economic strength is ready for space; soon our ships will be ready for space.Let's find out what space travel is all about.See also:Man and the Moon (1955)Mars and Beyond (1957)Challenge of Outer Space (circa 1950s)Animal Life on Mars (1957)Plant Life on Mars (1957)",

        "text": "Flying Platform - 1955The April 30, 1955 issue of Pacific Stars and Stripes (Tokyo, Japan) ran this short piece about the future of the helicopter. While it's certainly up for debate, I think the \"hoppi-copter\" pictured in the article below may be the most dangerous flying machine this side of a flying Ford Pinto. The many different shapes and sizes helicopter-like flying machines have assumed in recent years were designed mainly for military use but the future promises civilian occupations for almost all of them.The Navy's new \"flying platform\" is a recent example. The machine consists of a wingless circular platform. It contains two fans rotating in opposite directions and producing an air blast that lifts and propels the platform.Inexpensive and so simple to operate it could serve as an assault boat for the individual solider, it also may be the businessman's speedy coupe of the future.Another unusual whirlybird is the \"portable helicopter,\" a four-bladed rotor and engine weighing 60 pounds. To fly, the operator simply straps the contraption on his back, starts the motor and takes off.In war the infantryman might use it for airborne assaults. In peacetime the Dodger fan could take in a double header without having to fight stadium crowds on the way to the game.Previously on Paleo-Future:Shopper Hoppers (1959)Commuter Helicopter (1947)Transportation in 2000 A.D.

They describe the life of past generations in nostalgic terms, but do not really compare the lives of average housewives or factory workers today with the lives of their grandparents and with the drudgery, ignorance and poverty that characterized and blackened the past.Such prophets who fail to balance good against bad too often would have us merely shrink from the tools that new decades always bring, and thereby acknowledge defeat in what is admittedly going to be a difficult struggle. A difficult struggle is man's typical state. Reject change, and we will be enslaved by it; others will accept the worst of it and dictate to us. Accept change, and we may control it. We need the voices of our more balanced critics if we are to remember to look inside ourselves, not just crow about our surface achievements. But we need the voices of optimists too if we are to see a vision ahead, if we are to see what we can accomplish.Previously on Paleo-Future:Moving Sidewalks by Goodyear (1956)Solar Power of 1999 (1956)I want an oil-cream cone!

Shockey wrote a piece for the March-May, 1959 issue of Space Journal titled, \"The Ultimate Necessity of Space Travel.\"  Shockey makes the case for a trip to the moon and eventually further into space as a necessity brought about by the eventual destruction of Earth a few billion years from now.That trip to the moon was still a decade away but, as noted in the piece, was anticipated to be no sooner than 20 years out. An excerpt from the piece appears below.When one considers that our planet is doomed, at least as far as life is concerned, it is impossible to put meaningful value on the titanic forward struggle of life on Earth through billions of years.

        "text": "To many people of the year 2010 the 1953 book, The Road to Abundance, is a heretical, nightmarish vision of the future. Chemicals and factory farming are seen as the logical next step in the evolution of food production for mankind. Jacob Rosin, co-writing with Max Eastman, describes the eventual \"victory of chemistry over agriculture,\" and mankind's \"bondage to the planet.\" The ultimate goal of Rosin's ambition was to be \"more efficient than nature.\" In his advocacy of a completely synthetic diet Rosin called into question both the definition and the benefit of \"natural foods.\" It is therefore high time to remove the cloak of holiness from natural foods, and see them as what they are: a poorly assorted mixture of chemicals containing a large amount of indigestible materials, and a certain proportion of materials injurious to our health. This mixture has been, unfortunately, indispensable for our nutrition, since we have been unable up to now to obtain the chemicals required by our organism in a form entirely digestible and devoid of poison.As I mentioned in an earlier blog post, each time I read a book like The Road to Abundance I can't help but imagine what the grocery stores of 2010 would look like had different marketing forces prevailed. One can picture yuppies and hipsters walking the aisles of a grocery store in some alternate universe, content in knowing that their unnatural, Certified Inorganic™ food was scientifically proven to maximize this and detoxify that.

Well, cute in that condescending \"bless your heart\" kind of way. But cute, nonetheless.Remember that in 1955 the Interstate Highway System was still just a twinkle in President Eisenhower's eye. The Federal Aid Highway Act, which allocated $25 billion ($195 billion in today's dollars) for the development of the Interstate Highway System, wasn't signed into law until 1956.As a huge Disney nerd I can't help but think about short films and TV episodes from the late 50s which were clearly produced to sell the idea of the Interstate Highway System to the American public. The film The Story of Anyburg USA from 1957 and the Disneyland TV episode Magic Highway, USA from 1958 are two such glorious examples. Predictions from the Lewiston Daily Sun piece appear below. Automobile traffic will increase fantastically, but because of fine expressways, there will be little congestion.On these expressways cities will be by-passed or the road will be so built that it will hardly be necessary to slow down.There will be no traffic lights on these major roads.Large lakes will be bridged. Mountain ranges will be tunneled.Opposing traffic will be separated. One-way streets and highways will be the rule.Sleet? Snow? It will melt as it hits the highway.Headlights? Won't need them on major roads. They will be illuminated bright as day.Disabled cars -- a major source of tieups today -- will be whisked away by helicopter.Cities will use three-level highways. Underground parking will be common. New office buildings will have parking facilities on each floor. On a side note, I had a good chuckle reading about the helicopter solution to disabled cars, since comedian Eugene Mirman recently tweeted about Gallagher and his absolutely insane solution for road congestion.Previously on Paleofuture: Highways by Automation (1958)Magic Highway USA Publicity Stills (1958)Disney's Magic Highway, U.S.A.

Among other things, it was packed with films, a commemorative plate and gasoline (in case the people of 2007 didn't have any to start the car).The June 8, 1957 Victoria Advocate (Victoria, Texas) ran an article titled, \"Oklahoma Really Whooping It Up For 50th Birthday.\"In a steel vault, buried on the lawn before the City's modernistic skyscraper courthouse is a 1957 automobile and many another memento of Oklahoma's 50th year. \"Tulsarama!\" visitors filled out cards predicting the city's population in 2007. Closest guess will win the car - 50 years from now - along with a $100 trust fund, plus interest. The money will be paid to the heirs of the guesser if he or she is not alive in the centennial year.In June of 2007 they dug up the car. It was announced that Raymond Humbertson had, in 1957, submitted the guess (384,743) closest  to Tulsa's 2007 population (382,457). Time did not treat the car so well, as evidenced by the photo below. Mr. Humberston died in 1979. According to an AP story, his closest living heirs are two elderly sisters living in Maryland. It's not clear if they'll receive the trust fund money because according to the Tulsa World, it was \"set up with Sooner Federal Savings and Loan Association, which was liquidated in the 1990s.\"Be sure to check out the Flickr page of Michael Bates, who has some great photos of the unearthing.See also:Lost and Stolen Time CapsulesYear 2000 Time Capsule (1958)General Dynamics Astronautics Time Capsule (1963)Broken Time Capsule (1963-1997)",

They describe the life of past generations in nostalgic terms, but do not really compare the lives of average housewives or factory workers today with the lives of their grandparents and with the drudgery, ignorance and poverty that characterized and blackened the past. -- Victor Cohn, 1956Victor Cohn (undated photo)Victor Cohn was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota on August 14, 1919. He was raised in a lower-middle-class home, the son of Louis Cohn, a traveling salesman born in Chicago and Lillian Cohn, a housewife born in Minneapolis.Cohn began his career as a journalist at the University of Minnesota's student newspaper, The Daily, where he served as editor from 1940-41. He developed a passion for writing impactful stories that connected emotionally, as well as technically (as he largely wrote about science and health) with readers.Victor Cohn was an optimist. The kind of optimist who dared say the future had potential, that there was a chance everything could turn out alright. It is an attitude I admire, largely because it's an attitude I so rarely share. The problems facing the world today feel insurmountable in many ways.According to his son, Jeffrey Cohn, his father's analysis of news about advances in medical science was tremendously insightful. Victor Cohn said that every story fit into one of two categories -- new hope or no hope.In 1954 Cohn wrote a series of twelve syndicated articles for the Minneapolis Tribune titled 1999: Our Hopeful Future. The series was expanded into a book in 1956 and follows the Future (with a capital \"F\") family; John Future, his wife Emily Future, and their children, Timothy, Peter, Susan and Billy Future. The Future family goes about their futuristic business in a world free of the technological obstacles which faced mankind in the primitive 1950s. Pre-Jetsons and pre-Star Trek, the book serves as a kind of beautiful time capsule in which we imagine a distant and alien world. Disposable clothes, solar and nuclear-powered everything, TV-phones, lightning-fast transportation; the future was looking pretty sweet. But Cohn was not an unreasonable man. His technologically optimistic book was a vision of hope for a better world, whatever form that took. While studying yesterday's visions of tomorrow it's easy to forget that people of the 20th century were not all wide-eyed rubes who believed the future was pre-destined to be shiny, happy and plastic. Such prophets who fail to balance good against bad too often would have us merely shrink from the tools that new decades always bring, and thereby acknowledge defeat in what is admittedly going to be a difficult struggle. A difficult struggle is man's typical state. Reject change, and we will be enslaved by it; others will accept the worst of it and dictate to us. Accept change, and we may control it. We need the voices of our more balanced critics if we are to remember to look inside ourselves, not just crow about our surface achievements. But we need the voices of optimists too if we are to see a vision ahead, if we are to see what we can accomplish. -- Victor Cohn, 1956Thank you Victor Cohn, for reminding us that we must always be looking forward if we are to build a world where the \"prophets of misery\" are to be proved wrong.Previously on Paleo-Future:Moving Sidewalks by Goodyear (1956)I Want An Oil-Cream Cone!

Raised on Jurassic Park's pop version of chaos theory, I suppose that little Matty was deathly afraid a butterfly beating its wings in Indochina would cause a typhoon in Omaha. And thus, messing with a single little black raincloud would surely cause massive, unforeseen destruction.Ah, the carefree years of our youth.The May 28, 1954 issue of Collier's predicted that mankind (and by that we mean the United States) would eventually have complete control over weather. An excerpt from the piece by Capt. H.T. Orville appears below.A weather station in southeast Texas spots a threatening cloud formation moving toward Waco on its radar screen; the shape of the cloud indicates a tornado may be building up. An urgent warning is sent to Weather Control Headquarters. Back comes an order for aircraft to dissipate the cloud. And less than an hour after the incipient tornado was first sighted, the aircraft radios back: Mission accomplished. The storm was broken up; there was no loss of life, no property damage. This hypothetical destruction of a tornado in its infancy may sound fantastic today, but it could well become a reality within 40 years. In this age of the H-bomb and supersonic flight, it is quite possible that science will find ways not only to dissipate incipient tornadoes and hurricanes, but to influence all our weather to a degree that staggers the imagination.Read more:Closer Than We Think!

The illustrations can be found in the book Visions of Spaceflight: Images from the Ordway Collection.To provide safety in case of a malfunction of the reusable upper stage - von Braun's 1950s shuttle concept - crew and passengers press buttons on their chair arms. Contour seats straighten automatically and enclosures snap shut forming sealed escape capsules. To abandon ship, the crew and passengers push another button and the capsules, guided by rails, are ejected by explosive powder charges. The arrangement is seen in cross-section.After ejection, the capsules' descent is controlled by four-foot steel mesh parachutes. At about 150 above the ground or water, a proximity fuse sets off a small rocket that further slows the rate of fall.See also:Challenge of Outer Space (circa 1950s)The Complete Book of Space Travel (1956)General Dynamics Astronautics Time Capsule (1963)Mars and Beyond (1957)Man and the Moon (1955)Closer Than We Think!

        "title": "Will robots make people obsolete? (1959)",
        "text": "The January 4, 1959 issue of Parade magazine published a piece by Sid Ross titled, \"Will Robots Make People Obsolete?\"The piece in its entirety appears below in all its dystopian glory. Who knew that Parade could be so dark? The piece claims that in the future \"mankind's major struggle will be against boredom, with the suicide rate zooming as people lose the race.\"The heaviness of the piece, along with the accompanying illustration, raise so many questions. Chief among them, why would a family of four gleefully jump into that menacing robot's mouth?Secondly, why would Father be fed an entire pumpkin? For that matter, why is this evil machine feeding him at all?Is Robo-Dog attacking Little Johnny for a reason? Maybe Johnny pulled Robo-Dog's metal tail one too many times. I'm willing to accept the possibility that Johnny deserves what's coming to him.Lastly, despite the abject horror on Mother's face, the robot servant appears to be doing a damn fine job. Baby is happy and there's no indication that supper is burning. Granted, we have to assume that Mother was less-than-gingerly placed into that trash can by Mr. Octo-Eyes.(UPDATE: I've been informed that the illustration for this piece was done by the incredible Jim Flora.)Parade MagazineJanuary 4, 1959All over the world and on the colonies in outer space, everyone is excited about the most popular event of the year. All human activity stops as people breathlessly await the outcome of the world's championship tiddlywinks contest. In this world of the future mankind has little else to be excited about. For earth has been transformed into a \"paradise\" where incredibly clever robots take care of things. They do the farming, the factory work, run the trains, regulate traffic, enforce the law, cook the meals, clean the houses and distribute a vast wealth of goods and services to which every human being is entitled - merely by being alive.Almost nothing familiar on earth today will survive in this robotized world of the future. For instance:Only a privileged few will have the right to work at a job.The dream of youngsters will not be to grow up rich and successful, but to be one of the favored few workers.Juvenile delinquency will take the form of vandalism against robots.Everyone wil aspire for some kind of \"blue ribbon\" for an amateur activity, hobby or sport - possibly an award for the best ship model built out of matchsticks or the most colorful rock garden in town.Heroes and celebrities will be the persons who devise new parlor games.Withering Family LifeMankind's major struggle will be against boredom, with the suicide rate zooming as people lose the race.Governments and family life will wither away. Public officials will be replaced by Board of Supervisors to \"umpire\" games, sports and recreation, and also administer competitive exams which would decide who could work at the few essential jobs left for human beings to do.Fantastic? Certainly, by our everyday standards of progress. But every one of these dizzying pictures of life in the future could conceivably become real - when and if man creates robots to do his work for him. Man's mastery of science and technology is advancing by tremendous leaps and bounds. One of his major goals ever since the caveman harnessed an ox to a primitive plow, has been to make something else replace human muscle power. The ultimate \"something else\" is the robot that acts and thinks like a man.For the robot-powered society described here, Parade enlisted the fertile imagination and scientific knowledge of Isaac Asimov, an associate professor of bio-chemistry at the Boston University School of Medicine and a writer of science-fiction stories, including a series on robots.Awful to FaceWondrous as Asmiov's robotized world of the future may seem, the man who dreamed it up wants no part of it. Says Asimov, \"I'll be glad that I will have long since been dead rather than face life in such a society!\"In the transportation systems of the future, electronically guided robots will be the bus and truck drivers. There may be robots that can repair TV sets, fix the plumbing, run IBM machines, act as traffic policemen, read galley proofs, serve as \"information\" attendants at railway stations.\"In theory,\" says Asimov, \"there is no reason why any human job cannot be done by a machine if we can invent a robot brain as complex and as small as the human brain. Under such circumstances, there is no reason why a robot couldn't mentally be capable of doing anything a human can.\"But who will need man then? Man will die off of simple boredom and frustration.\" The reason, Asimov points out, is that comparatively few people can be usefully creative.Consider the Joneses, who in a robotized world, have lost their usefulness:Mr. and Mrs. Jones would have it easy. Their robot butler would awaken them gently, serve them breakfast in bed and wheel away and wash the dirty dishes. The robot valet and maid would choose the day's attire and dress them.\"Free\" for the day, Mr. and Mrs. Jones must decide what to do. Mrs. Jones doesn't have the drudgery of housekeeping. Mr. Jones has no job to go to, since robots are doing nearly all the work. Of course, he could spend the day tinkering with his sailboat, although he knows a robot could tune u p the auxiliary engine more efficiently. Mrs. Jones may decide to work in the garden. Her robot could do this better, but she jealously guards this privilege.Some people - the \"aristocracy\" in this strange robot society - would be entitled to work.See also:Closer Than We Think!

This material has a network of internal threads connecting the outside surfaces - the longer the threads, the greater the distances between those surfaces.

        "text": "The idea that advanced 21st century technology would lead to ridiculously short work weeks was incredibly popular in the 20th century. And why not? Improved efficiency meant we'd obviously be working less, right? Seems like common sense.I don't need to tell you that things didn't quite work out as the futurists had hoped. You're probably working more hours than ever; that is, if you're lucky enough to have a job at all.The article below ran in the November 26, 1967 Gastonia Gazette (Gastonia, NC). It assumes that people will be working significantly less and raises concerns that all this free time will lead to \"boredom, idleness, immorality, and increased personal violence.\" The piece even proposes the possibility of a guaranteed wage.Those who hunger for time off from work may take heart from the forecast of political scientist Sebastian de Grazia that the average work week, by the year 2000, will average 31 hours, and perhaps as few as 21. Twenty years later, on-the-job hours may have dwindled to 26, or even 16.But what will people do with all that free time? The outlook may not be cheery.As De Grazia sees it: \"There is reason to fear, as some do, that free time, forced free time, will bring on the restless tick of boredom, idleness, immorality, and increased personal violence. If the cause is identified as automation and the preference for higher intelligence, nonautomated jobs may increase, but they will carry the stigma of stupidity. Men will prefer not to work rather than to accept them. Those who do accept will increasingly come to be a politically inferior class.\"One possible solution: a separation of income from work; perhaps a guaranteed annual wage to provide \"the wherewithal for a life of leisure for all those who think they have the temperament.\"1967 Nov 26 Gastonia Gazette - Gastonia NC paleofuture \t\tPreviously on Paleo-Future:Little Work, Big Pay Forecast Year 2000 (1969)Henry Ford's Machine Men (1924)1999 A.D.

Well, ecologists tell us that in that year we will have run very nearly out of food, that half the world's population will be on a starvation diet. We can project the so-called electronic revolution and predict that the number of workers engaged in actual production will drop to only 18 percent of the workforce. At the same time, the number of people in all the various service occupations will almost double.Experts tell us that we will cluster more than ever into cities, drive electrically powered cars, work less, and retire earlier.

And after he's all dead and gone, so the heat of passion is taken out of the matter, a committee meets and studies his life. Cronkite: So during his lifetime then, he hasn't had any children?Bonner: He's been sterilized, and hasn't had any children in the normal way. After he's dead and gone, the committee meets and reviews his life and asks, 'Would we like to have some more people like him?' If the answer's no they take out his sex cells of the deep freeze and throw them away. But if the answer's yes then they use him to fertilize eggs similarly selected on the basis of review and validation of a person's contributions during his lifetime.

All you need is a credit card.These are some of the more bizarre ways you can use a credit card but their purchasing power covers the whole gamut of goods and services.It's estimated that Americans are carrying 200 million credit cards and using them to spend around $50 billion a year.As a result of the proliferation of credit cards, there has been widespread speculation about the possibilities of a checkless, cashless society in the future.Some bankers envision nationwide system In which a single identification card would be used in place of all checks and almost all cash.But American Express, a big name in the credit card industry, says, \"The single-card system couldn't be further from reality today. The most striking feature of our present system of transferring money is the multiplicity of credit cards.\"Credit cards as we know them today were pioneered in 1950 by Diners' Club, which was created with 200 members, an initial investment of $18,000 and a handful ot restaurants In the New York City area. Within a year it had grown to 10,000 members who could charge at more than 1,000 establishments.Credit cards now fall into three categories:—Travel and entertainment. Operators in this field are American Express, Diners' Club and Carte Blanche. These cards are held primarily by business and professional men.—Private label. Oil companies, airlines, hotels, car rental companies and department stores offer these cards primarily to promote their services or products.—Revolving credit cards. These cards, largely regional or local in nature, are issued mainly by banks and financial organizations and are meant primarily for use by housewives for shopping.The credit card companies derive their revenue from discounts from establishments which accept the cards in lieu of cash and from membership fees. Some credit card practices have come in for criticism recently, mainly because of the mailing of unsolicited cards by banks and some others in the revolving credit field.Read more:Credit Card Rings (1964)Online Shopping (1967)Prelude to a Great Depression (The Chronicle Telegram, 1929) ",

Hazard, the suit also appeared on the cover of Life magazine's April 27, 1962 issue. The entire two-page spread from the Post-Standard can be viewed below.\"You're going to land on the moon. You need a suit that will protect you against all the dangers you'll run into. You can start by figuring out what they are.\"That's the assignment Professor John Lyman handed his class in Experimental Engineering at U.C.LA. Along with it he gave them a rough model of a moon man's suit designed by California engineer Allyn B. Hazard. The class studied it, wore it, and tried to make it into a practical safeguard for our first moon man. They pin-pointed six major problems the suit must solve:Breathing: No air on the moon, so the suit must pack oxygen for at least 10 days.Hot-cold: The moon switches from a boiling 215 degrees F. in the daytime to 250 below at night. Suit must be power-heated and cooled, heavily insulated.Radiation: A phenomenon called \"solar flair\" intermittently showers the moon with very intense radiation. Suit must completely shield wearer.Vacuum effect: Suit must prevent fatal loss of moisture due to moon's near-vacuum atmosphere.Mobility: Moon's surface is thought to be covered with dust that may be 20 feet thick in places. Also, the atmospheric pressure inside the suit and absence of pressure outside will cause moon man's arms to fly up like Jimmy Durante's and stick there.Chow: Moon man must carry rations inside suit.You can see why the suit doesn't exactly have Ivy League cut. Our scientists have dubbed President Kennedy's proposed $40 billion man-to-the-moon project \"Apollo.\" Apollo should sue!--Joseph GiesPreviously on Paleo-Future:Space Suit (1956)Man and the Moon (1955)Exploring Space (1958)Man-Amplifier (1966)Journey Into Space (1952) ",

        "title": "A Trip Through Space for Boys and Girls (1954)",
        "text": "While flipping through the 1954 book A Trip Through Space I was struck by one aspect of the interstellar story that I've never noticed in a pre-Apollo book... a girl in space!Here at Paleofuture we've looked at quite a few books that told children of the 1950s and 60s about the wondrous world of space travel in store for them. But I can honestly say that I've never noticed one that included girls in this fantastic, space-faring future.Exploring Space, First Men to the Moon, Boytopia, The Complete Book of Space Travel; none of these depictions of future astronauts bothered to include women. A Trip Through Space was written by Catharine E. Barry, an associate curator at the Hayden Planetarium, but there isn't much information about her online. Any biographical information about Ms. Barry from readers is greatly appreciated.Now, I know that pointing out gender inequalities of the 1950s isn't a particularly novel observation and I only own about half a dozen children's books from the 1950s and 60s that envision future space travel. So it's difficult for me to definitively say how common depictions of female astronauts were during this period without more extensive research. With that said, I suspect that the girl in A Trip Through Space is a rare depiction indeed. I'm fascinated by what kind of stories we tell our children and how that shapes our society. The stories we hear as kids no doubt greatly influence our perspective on what's possible for the future, both globally and personally. Sally Ride became the first American woman in space* in 1983 -- the year I was born, in fact. What stories did Sally Ride hear growing up that set her on a path pursuing science? Growing up, how did she see herself fitting into the space program? As a 27 year old man who didn't grow up during the Space Age it's sometimes hard for me to gain personal perspective on things like this. I emailed Virginia Postrel, author of The Future and Its Enemies, columnist at Bloomberg and editor of the website Deep Glamour so that I might better understand the gender politics of the time. When I moved to Los Angeles I had dinner with Virginia, her husband and Paul Boutin at Cafe 50s, where a copy of the 1959 kid's book You Will Go to the Moon hangs on the wall. Over dinner Virginia talked about how much she loved that book when she was a little girl. Virginia's email to me appears below. When I was in kindergarten (roughly 1965), we had a time every day where we could look at books. My favorite books were You Will Go to the Moon (1959) and a book on the planets. I did read You Will Go to the Moon nearly every day, and I never noticed that the character in the book is a boy or that the text says, \"You will be a space man.\" I only noticed that decades later when the book turned up on the wall of Cafe 50s and I later acquired a used copy. As a child I never explicitly aspired to be an astronaut. It was more that I assumed that in the future people would go into space, perhaps on business trips or as tourists. I never got to the details. I don't know that more women being represented would have had much effect on me, because I've never had much of a problem identifying with male role models, but it might have made a difference for other girls. Later, in the early 1970s, when I was 12 or 13 I watched Star Trek, which, of course, had plenty of female characters. The recurring ones were a switchboard operator, a nurse, and a secretary, but there were nonrecurring scientists, diplomats, historians, etc. And it goes without saying that your comments about this time period -- educated or otherwise -- are more than welcome.*The first woman in space was Russian Valentina Tereshkova in 1963.",

        "text": "Since I was stuck at Chicago's O'Hare Airport all day, here's an article from the December 1, 1967 European edition of Stars and Stripes, which describes the airport of the future.An architect says he has an answer to the complaint that the longest and hardest part of a trip often is getting from home to the airport.Martin Schaffer, chairman of the board of an airplane architectural firm, envisions \"containerized\" passengers transported from near their homes to the plane and then to their destinations without leaving the seats in which they started.Schaffer, who served as project coordinator on construction of O'Hare International Airport in Chicago, says new airport facilities will be obsolete before they leave the drawing board unless some drastic changes are made.\"Airlines already have enough equipment in the air and on order to swamp every airport in the country by 1970,\" he said.\"Getting through traffic to the airport, and the handling of passengers and their baggage becomes more of a problem daily,\" Schaffer said, \"but with plans for 500 and 750-passenger planes to go into service in the next few years our airports will become chaotic.\"Schaffer emphasized that bigger airports with more buildings are not the answer.Shaffer's airport of the future has no large terminal buildings but consists mainly of runways for jets and circular landing pads for vertical takeoff planes. These planes are in the design stage, Shaffer said, and resemble helicopters except that they go faster and are propelled by rotating engines instead of blades.Shaffer said long, tiring drives to the airport followed by parking problems, long ticket lines, baggage check-in lines and then the long walk to the boarding area would be eliminated by his new transport system.Shaffer foresees passengers with their baggage boarding a \"pod\" from gathering points in the area serviced by the airport, Shaffer explained that the pods would be car-like compartments running on monorails through tunnels like an underground system or on an air cushion.Several pods, carrying about 75 passengers each, would be scheduled for a specific flight, Shaffer said, and after picking up the passengers at designated stops, would go directly to the field.Instead of seats for passengers, planes would consist of a large frame in which the pods would be inserted, the way baggage compartments are insterted into a frame now, Shaffer said.The pods could be detached from the air frame upon landing and could carry the passengers to different points at their destination, he said.\"We've got the technology to build this type of system within the next 15 years,\" Shaffer said.See also:Commuter Helicopter (1947)",

        "text": "The Official Souvenir Book of the 1964 New York World's Fair includes some gorgeous illustrations of futuristic space exploration. The Fair had phenomenal exhibits showcasing the American push into space, but if you're wondering what the Soviets put on display for 1964 -- smack in the middle of the space race -- you'll be disappointed to hear that they didn't even have a pavilion.Did the tensions of the Cold War keep the Soviets from coming to a fair whose motto was \"Peace Through Understanding\"? Not quite. The 1964 New York World's Fair wasn't even an officially sanctioned World's Fair. Robert Moses, the head organizer, decided to charge site rental fees for countries that wanted to have a pavilion and this put the Fair at odds with the Bureau of International Expositions (BIE). Many countries -- including Canada, Australia, the Soviet Union and most of Europe -- didn't have representation at the Fair when the BIE encouraged its members not to participate.With Americans trotting out jetpacks, videophones and futuristic highways it's kind of interesting to wonder what the Soviets might have done at the Fair in the name of Cold War competition.Below are pictures that appear in the Official Souvenir Book to the 1964 New York World's Fair.Without pause, man has rushed headlong into the nuclear age, the space age and the age of automation. A variety of exhibits at the Fair help the fairgoer catch up with this runaway revolution in technology and science. High points of this revolution are shown on these and the next eight pages. America's first steps into orbit around the earth and plans for future ventures into space are set forth in a number of cinematic space trips as well as in a host of real and scale-model exhibits of space-age hardware. The Cape Kennedy story at the Florida pavilion offers a photographic account of launchings, and the U.S. Space Park provides a showplace for Mercury, Gemini, Apollo and a unit of Saturn V, the rocket destined to boost Apollo to the moon.  Essential to Apollo's journey of discovery, this vehicle will ferry astronauts between their capsule and the moon. It is in the U.S. Space Park.  A Saturn I booster, with 1.5 million pounds of thrust, lifts a 20,000-pound payload in a blast-off typical of the space age. A scale model of Saturn I is displayed in Florida's Cape Kennedy exhibit.  A spaceport and supply rocket, designed by the Martin Marietta Corporation, meet in mid-air in this scene from the Hall of Science space show. In such a port, astronauts may orbit for half a year.",

        "text": "My friend Brian Horrigan, co-author of the retro-futurism bible Yesterday's Tomorrows, writes a blog for the Minnesota Historical Society called Covering 1968. Brian recently blogged about the cover of the December 14, 1968 Saturday Evening Post. Its headline, \"Are We Heading Toward the Day Everything Stops?\" is an odd juxtaposition against the colorful (though certainly crowded) world depicted by illustrator Gene Holtan.As Brian notes, the illustration style pays homage to popular futuristic images of the late 19th and early 20th century, like this one from an 1895 issue of Judge magazine. An excerpt from Brian's post appears below.The editors of the Saturday Evening Post suggest here that 1968 was similarly full of warning bells–and this time the “future shock” had to do with massive infrastructural gridlock.  ”We are going very fast just to stay where we are,” the editors write.  The nation has a choice of where it will be in 25 years (that is, 1993):  ”Either an efficiently computerized and integrated transportation system . . . or an air-land-and-sea traffic jam so enormous that it will bring our entire society to a virtual standstill.” If you live in the Twin Cities and don't yet have plans for Groundhog Day (I realize this is a very busy holiday for people) come to the Turf Club in St. Paul where Brian Horrigan and myself will be talking (and drinking) at the Minnesota Historical Society event, The History of Hip: Yesterday's Tomorrows.Previously on Paleo-Future:What We Are Coming To (1895)Futuristic Pollution Deflector (1968)The Prophetic Year 2000 (1968)Family Life to Be Greatly Altered by 21st Century (1968) ",

Tomorrow, this process may be speeded and regulated - as to size, quality and even color, thanks to intensive research work now under way. The U.S. Forest Service has already developed pine trees that mature twice as fast as today's ponderosa. Rayonier, Inc., is injecting radioactive carbon 14 into trunks to affect cellulose growth. Weyerhaeuser Co. has created new ways to avoid insect damage. And the U.S. Chamber of Commerce reports a treatment that will pre-color lumber while the trees are still growing; thus painting of wood may one day become a thing of the past.See also:Closer Than We Think!

Gray believes an answer might be found by cultivating certain fast-growing fungi rich in proteins. These fungi must be grown in large quantities of water, either salt of fresh, aerated by bubble streams.One way would be to mature the \"crop\" in the ocean. Plant flasks would be fastened to slowly rocking underwater tables supplied with air from hoses to the surface.

Such water, which is 7 degrees above freezing temperature because of the pressure on it, would in turn begin to melt the ice.Constant stirring would keep the warmer water coming to the surface. The ice in a designated area would gradually melt. The way would then be clear for conventional oil derricks to go to work.See also:Closer Than We Think! (1958-1963)Closer Than We Think!

Well, the October 16, 1967 Fresno Bee (Fresno, CA) ran a piece by Desa C. Belyea about the film and its futuristic family dynamic.Whenever talking about \"ignored futures\" I tend to point to this film as a great example. The future being sold includes a dazzling array of technological advances, while depicting a family with the same social and gender norms of the time in which it was created. An excerpt, along with the piece in its entirety appear below.The nagging wife will soon be obsolete -- another victim of progress.But if Dad thinks his days of being hen-pecked are over, just wait until he meets the new head of the household -- the electronic kitchen computer.The year is 1999. The scene: a typical American kitchen. The case: Mom, Dad and Junior. The plot: What is for lunch?Mom goes to her automated kitchen console and presses a series of buttons. In a few seconds today's menu appears on the electronic screen.The first one suggests consomme as a first course for all, a cheese omelet for Dad, cottage cheese and tomato for Mom and broiled chicken, mashed potatoes, spinach and mushrooms for Junior. All three get fresh fruit for dessert.The second menu is tomato juice for all, chicken salad for Dad, a tuna sandwich for Mom and broiled salmon, broccoli and carrots for Junior. Dessert for everybody is chocolate pudding.Dad says, \"Nuts, no machine is telling me what to eat, I'm having a cheeseburger with French fries and a cold bottle of beer.\"Mom consults her computer. The reply is, \"Sorry, cheeseburger, fries and beer are 400 calories over allotment. Suggest you try cold roast beef, green salad and low calorie beer.\" Click.And Dad scowlingly agrees. Mom presses the buttons on her console to order the meal and two minutes later the family sits down to lunch.After lunch, Dad tries to sneak off for a nap -- but, oh, no, Big Brother has plans for him. According to the health records maintained by the family computer, which each morning checks pules, temperature, weight and blood pressure, Dad needs to exercise and so off he marches, still grumbling, to do his pushups and kneebends.Nor is there any relief in sight. After exercises comes improvement hour. First, there is the study of mathematics, space navigation and foreign languages spewed forth on tape. Then a session on culture led by the auto-composer which reproduces the sounds of all instruments and offers Dad the opportunity to compose his own music.Finally, as Dad slumps in exhaustion, the little beep-beep reminds him that he still has his hobby projects to finish and so he trots off again, an unhappy victim of progress, as the curtain drops on Scene: 1999.A fantasy? An impossibility? Not according to the Philco-Ford Corporation which has just completed a color motion picture \"1999 A.D.\" in which the \"House of Tomorrow\" as envisioned by company engineers and industrial designers, will be displayed on movie screens in various film houses this fall and winter.The film 1999 A.D. can be purchased at AV Geeks.1967 Oct 16 Fresno Bee - Fresno, CA Paleo Future \t\t Previously on Paleo-Future:1999 A.D.

Just a year later, the 605 foot (185 meter) tower, which featured a revolving restaurant and observation deck, would be the crown jewel of the 1962 Seattle World's Fair. Dubbed the Century 21 Exposition, the Fair planners were eager to showcase American ingenuity with eyes firmly fixed on the future. The space race had begun in 1957 with the Soviet launch of Sputnik, so it only made sense that Americans would want the Space Needle to become a prominent symbol for the new Space Age.The ad below appeared in the February, 1962 issue of Holiday magazine.It's April 21, 1962, in Seattle... World's Fair time! The curtain's going up on the 21st Century... and on the most exciting preview ever seen. This is Seattle's spectacular Space-Age World's Fair, where the epic of man's journey into the next 100 years will unfold for you. What's ahead? How will man live? What will he see? Look at cities in the year 2000, see homes whose walls are jets of air, where cordless appliances work for you, cars ride without wheels, TV wrist telephones speed everyday communications. Time and distance wll disappear in the gigantic, pillar-less Coliseum Century 21, jutting eleven stories up from the heart of the fair. You'll soar past the moon into outer galaxies -- no space suit, no gravity, in the $9 million complex of the United States Science Pavilion. You will discover the secrets of the future in these six gleaming buildings rising above lighted fountains and courtyard pools. But it's not all the story of man's great tomorrows. Much of this $80 million show will be a glittering world of today. Dine atop the towering 60-story Space Needle which revolves to view Mt. Rainier, the Olympic and Cascade Ranges. Stroll Boulevards of the World filled with the sights and sounds of foreign lands. Thrill to the Monorail as it whisks you the mile from downtown Seattle in 95 seconds.  ",

And they most certainly didn't show up in the ways that people had been predicting them for decades. The videophone was to change the way we looked at home schooling, job interviews, medical diagnostics, and even dating.One of my favorite examples of videophone predictions is from the 1993 AT&amp;T concept video, Connections. After getting off a plane and meeting her family, a young woman wants to call her fiancee. But rather than reaching for her mobile phone the second the plane lands, she ventures to find the airport's video-payphones. Video-payphones, indeed!With Skype, iChat, Google Hangouts, Facebook Video Chat, and Facetime, videophone technology is all around us. But most people rarely see the need. That is to say, it's not important to always see the person you're communicating with. I'll video chat with the odd friend or co-worker on occasion, and it's great to see family back in the Midwest on holidays, but more often than not it simply feels unnecessary, even though the technology is so easy and inexpensive.The 1968 ad below depends on expensive infrastructure that hindered the widespread, pre-internet adoption of videophone technology. Produced for Western Electric, the ad can be found in the book The Golden Age of Advertising: The 60s. Western Electric is crossing a telephone with a TV set.What you'll use is called, simply enough, a Picturephone set. Someday it will let you see who you are talking to, and let them see you.The Picturephone set is just one of the communications of the future Western Electric is working on with Bell Telephone Laboratories.

With a decimated infrastructure those \"terra tires\" (crushing cars, mind you) would certainly come in handy. It's interesting that the illustration gives no clue as to what horror these people must be running from; an uncharacteristically chilling image from pop-utopian Radebaugh.Tomorrow's methods of coping with catastrophes will make our present-day equipment as obsolete as the horse-drawn drays that handled the San Francisco fire havoc in 1906.New king-size disaster wagons will face up to any kind of upheaval -- atomic, atmospheric or volcanic. Their low-pressure \"terra tire\" doughnut wheels will permit movement across any kind of terrain, traffic or wreckage.

A housewife convinces her husband that her new party dress is a good bargain because she'll be able to wear it four times before throwing it away. Vacationers, ready to head home, stuff campsite trash and bedding into pillowcases and throw them into the campfire. Disposable clothes are here - still being tested, but very much alive and kicking.The article goes on to talk about the American public's issues with waste.Part of the problem is one of salesmanship. Disposable clothes are still a novelty and command novelty prices. In addition, the American public is still hamstrung by the idea that waste is bad.See also:Closer Than We Think!

Buried by General Dynamics Astronautics in 1963, there is some question as to where it may now reside, as the General Dynamics Astronautics building has been torn down. Some guessed that it would be at the San Diego Air &amp; Space Museum but my last trip to that city turned up nothing. Hopefully, this time capsule hasn't been lost forever.The piece below by California Governor Edmund G. Brown appears on page six of the time capsule booklet.The Honorable Edmund G. BrownGovernor, State of CaliforniaI have been asked by those responsible for placing this \"space\" capsule to write down my guesses about the state of man's space efforts one hundred years from this date when, hopefully, this capsule will be opened.Most of my life has been spent as a politician. Politicians generally know very little about rockets, satellites and the other trappings of outer space.It is their task to be concerned about inner space, the still undiscovered space of the mind and the spirit, and about whether the institutions of men on this planet create for the men they are supposed to serve the atmosphere, the psychological spaciousness, in which they can grow to fulfill their human potential.This is the \"space\" about which I am concerned in 1963 as I write this statement. Even here, on ground that is much more familiar to me than is outer space, I have few predictions, but many hopes, about life on earth one hundred years from now.My chief hope is that by the time men will have truly grasped the overriding necessity of freedom as a condition of man's continued existence: freedom from the necessity to hate as well as freedom from oppression of the mind, the spirit and the body.I hope too that, having grasped this imperative, man, one hundred years from 1963, will have transformed his institutions into guarantors of that freedom.See also:General Dynamics Astronautics Time Capsule (1963)Broken Time Capsule (1963-1997)Lyndon B.

Remember that 1967 was the same year Philco-Ford depicted some pretty spot-on predictions about the future of personal computing in a film about the year 1999...But after reading the article it's not entirely clear to me from where they expect this invasion of privacy to be coming. Is this a fear of camera surveillance brought about by technological progress? And if so, by whom? The government? Your neighbors?The article is reprinted from the New York Times and quotes Harry Kalven, Jr., a professor of law at the University of Chicago:[...] by the year 2000, \"man's technical inventiveness may, in terms of privacy, have turned the whole community into the equivalent of an army barracks.

The article turns into a very specific endorsement/advertisement of a new LP by The Sandpipers. Do you think there was some payola going on in the newspaper industry as well as the radio business?NEW YORK (UPI) - It is true that more melodic pop music was produced in the 1930s than in any other decade in this century, yet no era or generation can claim a monopoly on good sound. And it may be that the pop musicologists of the 1990s may report to their generations that some elegant tunes were composed in the 1960s.\"Spanish Eyes,\" \"Love Is Blue,\" and perhaps a show tune such as \"Cabaret\" have a good chance of being in some group's catalogue of popular standards at the turn of the next century.Both \"Spanish Eyes\" and \"Love is Blue\" are among the 11 selections in an outstanding LP entitled \"Softly\" by The Sandpipers (A&amp;M SP4147). These melodic and nostalgic numbers are handled magnificently by The Sandpipers, who have appeal to all ages.But the feature song is \"Quando M'Innamoro,\" which also has a foot in the musical door of the future. And the opening number, \"Softly,\" is restful musical medicine.See also:All the Music of the Centuries (1908)Robots vs. Musicians (1931) ",

Neither do I.But this April 9, 1961 edition of Closer Than We Think (which appeared in the Chicago Tribune) treats the phrase as a part of humanity's natural progression in the advancement of science. I imagine what a different world we'd be living in if \"FACTORY FARMED!\" were plastered on food packaging rather than \"ORGANIC!\" or \"ALL-NATURAL!\" That world somehow seems just as plausible given a few historical and societal tweaks. Those giant tomatoes could have been pulled directly from John Elfreth Watkin's December, 1900 piece for the Ladies' Home Journal. And those monorail tank cars are certainly reminiscent of the high-speed freightways used to transport food in the 1958 Disneyland TV episode Magic Highway, U.S.A.The full text of the strip appears below.Agriculture in the world of tomorrow will be so mechanized that farms will actually resemble factories. Crops and livestock will be raised on regular schedules under uniform and carefully controlled conditions.\"Sensors,\" those automatic control devices for today's wonder machines, will be adapted to the requirements of precisions agriculture. They will take the place of human judgement in deciding and reacting to soil conditions, crop maturity, moisture levels, weather forecasting, feeding needs, etc. Bendix researcher W. E.

The third in the series dealt with life, work and family issues humanity would face in the year 2000. As I've discussed before, major social issues are largely ignored in 20th century American futurism, so it's interesting when we stumble upon serious predictions about major social change by the year 2000.A short excerpt appears below, but you can read the entire first page of the article here.By the year 2000 Americans may travel by ballistic missile, swallow a pill for a meal and wear tights and helmets like people in science fiction comic strips. Or they may not. There's no way of telling, and perhaps it doesn't make much difference. What matters is the quality of life: What will it be like to live in the year 2000? No one can draw the complete picture, but members of the Commission on the Year 2000 took glimpses from special points of view.Will people be able to learn and remember what they need to know in the complex world of 2000? Not without help, predicts psychologist George A. Miller of Harvard University.How will new biological techniques affect relations between the sexes? Perhaps by eliminating marriage and the family, suggested anthropologist Margaret Mead of New York's Museum of Natural History.What will earning a living be like for Americans? Easier, Herman Kahn and Anthony J. Wiener of the Hudson Institute calculate. Maybe too easy.Will there be any privacy left?

It wasn't moved to Disneyland like Carousel of Progress or It's A Small World, and it wasn't a sexy sequel like Futurama II. But it looked like quite the ride nonetheless.Narrated by Walt Disney, fairgoers hopped into Fords on a journey from the age of the dinosaurs to the invention of the wheel to a \"highway in the sky carrying you across the boundless night and out into time and space.\" The audio-animatronic dinosaurs and cavemen of Magic Skyway would be familiar to anyone visiting a Disney park today, as Epcot's Spaceship Earth, Universe of Energy and World of Motion (R.I.P.) all look like they drew quite a bit of inspiration from this attraction.At the end of the ride Walt's familiar voice proclaimed, \"perhaps someday we'll be riding rocketships like those flashing overhead to anywhere in space. Perhaps someday we will drive jet-powered vehicles over weather-controlled highways in the sky like those spiralling tubes around you.\" Perhaps indeed.For more on Ford's Magic Skyway check out the video below.

It is logically and practical and the trend of the industry thinking is in that direction.\"The author of the article then seems to mock the very idea with a flippant comment about crystal balls.If you can't buy a camera or processing box like that, maybe you can shop around for a crystal ball.

Garco appeared on numerous TV shows, including one of my favorite pieces of retro-space-futurism, the 1957 Disneyland TV episode, \"Mars and Beyond.\" I can't seem to find any clue as to where this robot might be stored. Is Garco sitting in some guy's basement in Billings? Some museum I've never heard of? Robot heaven? If you have any info on his whereabouts please contact me immediately. I will not rest until this lovable hunk of metal is found!The article below announcing Garco's retirement is from the July 31, 1961 Los Angeles Times.  Garco Shows Signs of Wear, Will RetireA mechanical man who can play chess, mix drinks, hammer nails and carry out other assingments with human encouragement will retire from active duty soon.His mechanism is breaking down. The Garrett Corp. owns the robot.\"We are hoping to find a permanent home for him in the Smithsonian Institute or some other museum where he can be preserved for posterity,\" said Mickey Parr, a company spokesman.Active RobotWorkers who built him eight years ago with surplus aircraft parts call him \"Garco.\" They contend he has had more activity in his short lifetime than the average man sees in a span of 70 years.Since 1953 Garco has taken part in several motion pictures, television shows, commercials and appeared at numerous charity events.Delicate ChildBut from the start Garco proved to be a delicate child. His problems arose from mechanical sickness, often causing his operating system to break down. As a result, the company always kept an engineer assigned to Garco. The engineer in charge of the mechanical man would keep Garco in his garage at home.Mechanical DoctoringPresently, Garco is receiving mechanical doctoring from Gray Rollo, 5308 Clearsight St.\"I've had a lot of fun working on him,\" Rollo said, \"and at times I wonder if he isn't really human. He certainly acts more intelligently than some people I know.\" Previously on Paleo-Future:Mars and Beyond (1957) Will Robots Make People Obsolete? (1959)Closer Than We Think!

        "text": "The advertisement below ran in the Official Souvenir Program for the 1962 Seattle World's Fair. The ad proclaims that General Motors is, \"setting a course for the future\" by showcasing the \"fully functional Firebird III space-age car.\" The full text of the ad is transcribed below.Mobility - the easiest, fastest, surest kind possible - turns your world of tomorrow into an accessible and amicable place. The fret is removed from traffic and it is fun, not frustrating, to take short jaunts on vehicles which float along on a pad of air or to Sunday-drive down automatic highways.The General Motors Corporation exhibit in the Coliseum presents a preview of the fascinating changes coming in the automobile industry. You see now the full-size, experimental Firebird III. This pace-setter for the car of the future, proven in road tests, is thrust with a turbine engine. Its simple control stick accelerates, brakes and turns. Push the control forward and the Firebird III moves ahead; swing it left or right and the wheels turn; pull back and it brakes. The electronic guide system can rush it over an automatic highway while the driver relaxes.Although the Firebird II stands as the center attraction in the exhibit, you see other displays of the future. There is a model of the automatic highway, prototype of a stretch of experimental roadway which was built in New Jersey to demonstrate how electronics can steer cars and even stop them. This quarter-mile stretch of road has been received enthusiastically by officials, who predict that electronic mechanisms in the future can eliminate routine driving chores and make long distance highway travel safer and easier.The General Motors exhibit includes solar energy demonstrations and you may test your skill with sun-powered guns which activate parts of the display. Yet another exhibit reveals the principles of ground effect machinery, where objects are moved along a flat surface on a cushion of air. In the next century, more people will be going more places in fascinating new vehicles . . . and they'll go safely.See also:Magic Highway, U.S.A.

Below are excerpts from the interview.How about innovations for the American home? How will we be keeping ourselves warm or cool?I don't believe in innovation. I think we'll probably go slightly backward in that regard. We've had too much and we can't keep the air-conditioning systems running that we've put in.What about green grass and trees and fresh water and clean air?Ah, green grass and clear water and beautiful air . . . it's a nice dream, uh, are we going to have it or not I think depends on what the people of America want.See also:2000 A.D.

        "text": "For the February, 1967 issue of The Futurist magazine, Hubert H. Humphrey, wrote a piece articulating his vision of the future. The Vice President broke up his thoughts into two categories; Developments of the Next 20 Years, and Far-Out Developments by A.D. 2000.Here are some of the developments we can look forward to within the next 20 years:In agriculture, the large-scale use of de-salinated sea water.In medicine, the transplantation of natural organs and the use of artificial ones.In psychiatry, the widespread application of drugs that control or modify the personality.In education, the use of more sophisticated teaching machines.In wordwide communication, the everyday employment of translating machines.In industry, the extensive use of automation, up to and including some kinds of decision-making at the management level.In space, the establishment of a permanent base upon the moon.Some of you might say that there is nothing very surprising here. And you would be right.Experience shows that it takes 10 to 30 years for a new idea to make its way from its inception in a scientist's mind to its general application in everyday life. Therefore, the world of 20 years from now already exists, in embryo, in today's advanced research establishments.A theme in 1960's America that seems to pop up repeatedly is faith in a permanent moon base. Tomorrow we'll look at Hubert H. Humphrey's predicitions for the year 2000.",

        "title": "Jamaican Food in 2000 A.D. (1969)",
        "text": "The December 4, 1969 Daily Gleaner (Kingston, Jamaica) ran a piece by James MacDonald titled, \"Food in 2000 A.D.\" that examined the food of the future within the context of Jamaican beef imports and communal eating. It is interesting to note that the communal kitchen concept was very much in vogue in the late nineteenth century (see Looking Backward  by Edward Bellamy) and seemed to make a comeback in the 1960s and 70s. Below are excerpts from the piece.Milk that never saw a cow, fruit that never grew on a tree or in the ground, and steak bearing no relation to a bullock -- in other words, fabricated food. It sounds a little distasteful and perhaps unbelievable but, according to eminent scientists studying food science it is inevitable and will be soon on our tables.Take the steak for instance. Soya beans can be woven to resemble a bullock's muscle, the fat presents no problem nor do vitamins, colouring is simple and flavour can be injected to order. The stuff can be even made to suit the taste buds of an institutional canteen or those who like to see blood.The development is not a new one - vegetarian Seventh Day Adventists have been eating this type of meat for the past forty years - but it is developing rapidly in recent years, and could hang a large question mark over the future of beef herds. Here in Jamaica it might solve the problem we have of having to import so much beef though I doubt if a patty would ever taste the same again.Food Technologists also forecast the days of communal feeding, when whole sections of the community, several streets joined together, would be served by a communal kitchen. Mrs. Community, tired of her cooking chores, will simply pick up the phone and order any variety of quality convenience foods from the self-serving central chef. An indication of this trend is visible at the moment in the home delivery services of some restaurants and also the ready to heat TV Dinners. Quality at the moment may leave a lot to be desired but in the future, new methods of keeping food such as A.F.D. (Accelerated Freeze Drying) and cooking Infra-Ray Ovens will keep the gourmets happy. The result - less time spent on cooking and shopping and more time for leisure.See also:That Synthetic Food of the Future (Ogden Standard-Examiner, 1926)Food of the Future (Indiana Progress, 1896)Delicious Waste Liquids of the Future (1982)",

I haven’t flown in years, but I understand that the famous “Mobile Terminals” are finally gone, a case of a futuristic idea that didn’t work all that well in the real world.The handful of times that I've been through the Dulles airport I've felt that I was going to miss my flight because of those slow moving shuttles. I hadn't heard that they might be doing away with the mobile lounges. Can anyone confirm that this is true? The text from \"Jetscalator\" appears below:Jet planes and the number of passengers they carry are getting bigger and bigger. Distances between terminals and loading docks are getting longer. The answer is a traveling waiting room with a moving ramp. Such a project is already being developed by the Chrysler Corporation, and it may be used at the new Washington, D.C., terminal now being designed by Eero Saarinen. The \"jetscalator,\" as it might be called, would move on wheels higher than a man.It would have an up-or-down ramp and capacity for about 100 people. When departure time is at hand, travelers wouldn't have to stir from their chairs - they'd be transported in the \"jetscalator\" right to the side of the plane.Next week: Cellar-size ScoopersRead more:Luggage Blowers (1961)Airport of the Future (1967)Fuller's Traveling Cartridge (circa 1960s)Passenger Air Travel (1945)Closer Than We Think!

The entire article appears below. The address of Gillis at the Holiday Inn was on \"The Year 2000.\"Gillis called control the key word in urging Kiwanians to work for an educational system that will enlarge man's understanding, control and enjoyment of life.\"Looking ahead to prepare ourselves and our children, Gillis said. \"Let us gather up as much as we can of this great civilized heritage which began here in Virginia while we still have it and transmit it on to our children. They will be grateful for this and it will give them the opportunity to enjoy the next fabulous 31 years, and we will know we have done something of worth.\"During the next two decades, Gillis said, \"young people will make up the greatest part of the U.S. population growth. Indeed, ours is a young population, with the trend moving strongly in the direction of a national population in which half of our people will be under 26 years of age in just a few years.\"During the rapid growth in the population in which time \"two per cent will be able to produce all the food needed by this country. . . the migration of people from rural areas to cities, from undeveloped societies to industrial ones, from poverty pockets to more affluent areas, will continue to take place at a fast rate.\"A distinguishing feature of rural America in the year 2000 . . . will be towers containing television scanners to keep an eye on robot tractors. The owner of the farm of the future will no more be out riding a tractor than the president of General Motors is out today on the assembly line, tightening bolts,\" said Gillis.For the women in the homes, Gillis said, \"All she will have to do to order a meal will simply be to punch a few instructions out and food will be transferred from the storage compartment to the oven at the proper intervals and cooked.\" He added, \"Food preparation will be completely automated. By the year 2000, we will have eliminated the pot and pan.\"Gillis said he wishes very much to live through the next 31 years. \"I am anxious to see the time come when grass will only grow to a certain height and stay green continually, and the sound of the lawn mower will no longer be heard in the land.\"Incomes will be increased greatly said Gillis.

This problem is being intensively studied, and new methods of speedier handling are being researched.One suggestion involves the use of aluminum containers floated on air cushions created by low-pressure jets. The next logical step would be the elimination of the containers themselves. Then just the luggage would be floated along ramps - faster than incoming passengers could walk to the baggage claim section.Next week: Space Traffic CopSee also:Closer Than We Think!

The picture [above], depicts Apollo lunar modules; that in the background carries a shelter and the other has landed a one man roving vehicle with a range of 8 km. This system would permit 14 day scientific missions in 1971-72, including geological drilling to about 35 m.

In other words, more will be accomplished in space than we can now come anywhere near labeling as specific projects and benefits.Among the space activities in the next one hundred years will probably be: weather control, global communication, global navigation, regular travel of people and freight between places on earth and space stations and the planets, and international policing against space and terrestrial conflicts.The benefits flowing from space activities will be even more widespread than the space activities per se. Education, language, living standards, and world peace will all benefit as space exploration and space living become a permanent part of man's institutional structure.See also:General Dynamics Astronautics Time Capsule (1963)Broken Time Capsule (1963-1997)",

The November 15, 2007 issue of Rolling Stone also has an article about paleo-futurism, although I haven't read that one yet. An excerpt from the Wall Street Journal piece appears below but just to clarify, there were only 24 episodes of the original 1960s version of the Jetsons. New episodes were produced in the 1980s.I doubt the creators of \"The Jetsons\" ever imagined how they'd influence kids growing up in the 1970s. The last episode of the original \"Jetsons\" aired in the spring of 1963, but its real heyday came in syndication, with the show playing on what seemed like continuous loop in the late 1970s. Amazingly, there were only 24 \"Jetsons\" episodes --- it's a bit frightening to imagine how many times I must have seen each one.And I'm not alone. Rolling Stone just released another anniversary issue, this one interviewing 25 big names about the future of the music industry, global warming, politics and the like. Turns out a fair number of Rolling Stone's famous interviewees spent their childhoods the same way I did: watching George and Jane and Judy and Elroy.Kanye West and Bruce Springsteen would like their flying cars already. The future was \"The Jetsons,\" George Clooney recalls -- it \"meant getting into a silver costume with a ring around your neck and riding around in floating cars. It was antiseptic and perfect.\" Chris Rock also grew up expecting airborne cars and moving sidewalks. Mr. Clooney finds it \"funny that none of it really came around,\" but Mr. Rock notes that flying cars aside, \"The Jetsons pretty much came true. My kid even has a mechanical dog that does flips.\" (Who's right? I'll get to that.)See also:Paleo-Future in the Wall Street Journal",

        "text": "The September 4, 1965 Press Courier (Oxnard, CA) ran an article titled, \"Physiologist sees mile run in 3:41 by year 2000.\" The entire article appears below.In case you were wondering, the actual world record in 2000 was 3:43.13, set by Hicham El Guerrouj of Morocco, according to Running Times magazine.How fast will man run the mile in the year 2000?The answer, according to Oxford University physiologist B.B. Lloyd, is three minutes, 41 seconds - more than 12 seconds faster than French athlete Michel Jazy's current world mark of 03.53.6.Lloyd, addressing the annual convention of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, said the trends in record breaking of the past 50 years were likely to continue for the next 50.Records keep getting broken, he said, because athletes keep getting \"greater hearted\" - their muscles get more oxygen from the blood pumped to them by the heart.Thus, he thought the reason for improvement lay not so much in individual skill as in more intensive selection and training, particularly during the final stages of growth.These were his forecasts for other world marks at the end of the century.100 yards: 8.6 seconds, now 9.1.440 yards: 42.4 seconds, now 44.9.10,000 meters: 26:08.4, now 27:39.4Marathon: two hours, two minutes, now two hours, 12 minutes. [paleo-future editor's note: Khalid Khannouchi of Morocco held the record in the year 2000 with two hours, five minutes and forty-two seconds.]Lloyd said the ability of a runner to use oxygen had increased about eight per cent since 1930.He added:'There seems no reason why a similar rate of increase should not be seen for the next 50 years, particularly as the maximum capacity to use oxygen in cross country skiers has already been shown as six per cent larger than that of record breaking miler John Landy.And he forecast that women may overtake men in sprint events. Women, he said, can use their original stores of energy faster than men.See also:Lunar High Jump (1979)Sport in Space Colonies (1977)Olympic Games on the Moon in 2020 (1979)",

In the 1970s the three-wheeled Dale car was supposed to get seventy miles to the gallon, but both the car and its inventor were ultimately revealed to be frauds. In the 1930s American newspapers warned that a robot in England had risen up against its inventor and shot him.In the mid and late 1960s a highly suspicious robot made the publicity circuit with its \"inventor,\" magician Mark Wilson promoting everything from computers to blenders. With Wilson at the controls and a blue ladybot stiffly walking like a zombie to prove just how mechanical she was, it was quite a sight to behold. In this newsreel from 1968 the \"robot\" is known as Miss Honeywell and the narrator himself even calls into question the veracity of the operator's claims.The \"woman in a robot suit\" stunt is so transparent as to likely be harmless, but you have to wonder how many people saw this robot's demonstration and thought it was real. As we know, there are still some children of the 1980's who think, thanks to Back to the Future II director Robert Zemeckis, that hoverboards were taken off shelves by overzealous child-safety groups.The ad below of Miss Honeywell -- or in this case, the \"housewife of the future -- appeared in the October 9, 1966 Oakland Tribune.Come see the robot \"housewife of tomorrow\" plugged in October 10th to 15th.The Hamilton Beach robot \"housewife of tomorrow\" will be demonstrated in our 15th and Broadway window. She is the amazing robot who is programmed to do all the cleaning.

        "text": "The July 19, 1965 Delta Democrat-Times (Greenville, MS) ran a piece by Lyle Wilson proclaiming that by the year 2000, \"there will be a Negro president of the United States, a Negro on the Supreme Court, [and] one or more in the U.S. Senate.\" The full text appears below.Leftwing political realists in both major political parties are looking eagerly beyond the era of appointment of Negroes to high federal office to the time when there will be a Negro president of the United States, a Negro on the Supreme Court, one or more in the U.S. Senate. Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, D-N.Y., cited  the trend after his brother was elected president. In an address aimed at the emerging African nations, Kennedy said; \"And now we have an Irish Catholic as president of the United States. The same kind of progress can be made by U.S. Negroes.\"Kennedy related the political rise of Irish American Roman Catholics in the United States to the possibilities open to American Negroes, Sen. Jacob Javits, R-N.Y., was encouraged by the 1957 (Eisenhower administration) civil rights legislation to predict that there would be a Negro cabinet member, a Negro president or a Negro vice president by the year 2000.Writing in the magazine Esquire, Javits said that as of 1958, the immediate goal of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People was to be the election in 1960 of three Negro congressmen from Mississippi and one each from North Carolina and South Carolina. NAACP didn't make it in 1960 but has mounted a continuing campaign.Javits wrote that he hoped and believed that U.S. Negroes would attain the suggested political heights on the basis of practical political considerations.\"Once the (civil rights) fight has won for Negroes in the South their constitutional right to vote,\" Javits wrote, \"and once they learn to take the full responsibility of voting, this country may well witness a ballot box revolution in many southern states.\"Javits believes that 30 to 40 Negroes will be elected to the 107th Congress which will convene in January, 2001. He wrote that Negro leaders had told him that it would be possible to nominate a Negro to the Supreme Court in 1968 and that there would be by then a Negro member of the U.S. Senate.Well before 2000, Javits expects a Negro to be elected mayor in New York, Chicago, Philadelphia and Los Angeles. He wrote in 1958 that he expected school desegregation to be completed by 1965, Javits calculations are based on a steady increase of the Negro vote for local and federal office under protection of federal law.Another consideration is the population shift of Negroes to the great northern and eastern cities. A result of such a shift can be seen in New York City where the Borough of Manhattan elected in 1953 and re-elected in 1957 a Negro named Hulan Jack to be borough president, Jack, in effect, is mayor of the island of Manhattan, the one the Indians sold.By now that important job is 100 per cent segregated. New York's commitment to politics on the basis of race and religion apparently has reserved forever the Manhattan Borough presidency for a Negro.New York politicians see no harm in that kind of segregation.Javits estimated that by 2000 one out of four persons in New York City will be Negroes, one of three in Chicago and one of two in Los Angeles. The political impact of that would be considerable.See also:Future Shock - Skin Color (1972)Future \"Brotherhood\" (1976) ",

        "text": "  We've looked at a lot of the ways in which advertisers have positioned themselves as being in touch with \"the future.\" The future's been used to advertise appliance stores, power companies, airlines, phone companies, aluminum, TVs, beer and refrigerators, refrigerators, refrigerators; pretty much any consumer product or service you can think of.By associating their brand with cutting edge design and glamour, advertisers are afforded the leniency of fantasy and fluff while still maintaining some level of respectability. The future is a perfect foil for conservative brands -- even something as boring as an insurance company -- to project fanciful ideas rooted in the long-term thinking expected of them.The advertisement below is for the insurance company Michigan Mutual Liability and appeared in the September 12, 1962 Record-Eagle (Traverse City, MI). It predicts everything from picnics on Mars to oddly shaped money in 2012, significant for the insurance company as its centennial year.HAVE A HAPPY TRIP! By 2012 AD, Mars may make a nice site for a family picnic, via your space craft, with a few stops for refreshments at space platforms along the way. Earth's Moon may be the site of our suburbs. Our Sun with an absolute surface temperature of 6000 degrees, is apt to be too warm for a pleasure trip. But Saturn, Jupiter, Uranus, Mercury and Venus may be more hospitable, and there are of course, trillions of other planets and suns beyond our Solar System to tempt the space traveler.This month marks our 50th birthday. While it's fun to look back on our past half century, we think it's even more interesting to look ahead to our next one. And here's what we plan for the year 2012:Whether \"autos\" are traveling on \"space beams\" to other planets, operating beneath oceans, on compressed air, or are radar controlled... we plan to be far ahead in anticipating our policyholders' insurance needs as we have been in the past. (For instance, we started providing auto insurance when horse drawn vehicles were still a relative commonplace. We pioneered in offering motorists discounts that grow larger each accident and claim free year. More recently, we introduced a pay-as-you-drive plan that lets motorists spread costs on a monthly basis.)Entire communities may be enclosed beneath huge plastic domes providing community-wide air-conditioning in 2012. Or they may float in space... or be underground. Wherever they are, we plan to provide our homeowner policyholders with the greatest amount of financial protection practical, against personal liability, property damage, casualty losses... just as we do now. (We pioneered in combining four major homeowner insurance needs in a single package. And Now -- you can pay for your Homeowners Insurance, with us, on a monthly basis.)The shape of money may change, but we'll pass on all savings, all economies, to our policyholders in the year 2012... just as we do today. (Michigan Mutual Liability Company, you see, is owned by its policyholders -- operated for their benefit, so they're entitled to the most complete insurance it's practical to provide... at the lowest cost consistent with sound management.)We plan to continue our growth pattern, too... having already become one of the ten largest companies of our kind since we pioneered with Workmen's Compensation Insurance back in 1912.Secure your future... Insure with Michigan Mutual ",

        "text": "Remember when adding \"2000\" to a product name was shorthand for futuristic, cutting-edge technology?In 1969 RCA invited the American public to \"take a leap into the year 2000\" with a new television set called The Two Thousand. Selling a limited edition of 2,000 sets at $2,000 a pop, (about $12,000 in 2008 dollars), The Two Thousand certainly turned heads.The advertisement above appears in a book about the history of television advertising, Window to the Future. The ad below appeared in the December 18, 1969 Albuquerque Journal (Albuquerque, NM).From the Albuquerque Journal:In one giant step RCA harnessed the speed and accuracy of the computer to help unveil a new century in color television. It's a limited edition (2,000 sets) with unlimited advancement. First and most obvious, is its 21st century design, its sculptured whiteness curves to a rosewood veneer top. The black translucent doors slide back and disappear into the set, revealing the 23-inch diagonal screen.And what a picture you'll see on that screen.It's the new RCA Hi-Lite 70 tube - computer designed and engineered for 100% more brightness than any previous big screen RCA color tube. The Hi-Lite 70 tube gives such a vivid, detailed picture, you can even watch it in a brightly-lit room.The remote controls of color, tint and volume are computer-designed too. They operate electronically so there are no motors, no noise, and no moving parts to wear out or break down.Inside The Two Thousand, though, is the biggest news.RCA eliminated the conventional VHF tuner. In its place are new computer-like \"memory\" circuits - electronic circuits with memories like tiny computers.When you press the remote control button, the circuits automatically remember which channels you have programmed. So there's no wandering through empty channels for the station you want. You simply go silently and instantly from one live station to the next.Press the UHF lever and the signal seeking circuitry takes over. A silent motor sweeps up and down the UHF band, seeking an active channel. When it finds one it stops. There's never any need to fine-tune the pictures. It's done for you electronically.The Two Thousand represents the pinnacle of achievement in Color TV engineering and performance. Open its doors and embark on a totally new viewing adventure.Read More:Television of Tomorrow (1974)Living Room of the Future (1979)Motorola Television (1961-1963)Motorola Television Revisited (1961-1963) ",

Looking at this image makes me think that someone could produce some pretty awesome steampunk art featuring James J. Hill and a Katrina Van Televox type robot, even though the \"robots\" described in this strip weren't of the humanoid variety.Future trains will be fully automatic -- robots that can regulate their own speed and control their own movements to meet the most precise schedules.The Union Switch and Signal Division is currently working on two kinds of electronic \"brains\" to make this possible. One type would be a trackside \"decision maker,\" to regulate train speed, routing, starting and stopping. The other would be a \"control servo,\" to signal that the robot train is obeying orders -- or isn't, and why. A central monitoring panel would oversee train movements for hundreds of square miles. The first such installation may be on the New York subway shuttle trains.Next week: Lunar Power PackThanks to Tom Z. for supplying the color version of this strip.Previously on Paleo-Future:Closer Than We Think (1958-1963)Farm to Market (1958)Speed is Key to Future Travel (1965)Car-on-Train Pallet System (1968)Robot Drivers (1985) ",

The satellite lunch box from 1958 shows a torodial space station, which is featured prominently in the short film Challenge of Outer Space. Excerpts from the Smithsonian website appear below each picture.Satellite Lunch Box (1958)The Soviet launch of the Sputnik satellite in late 1957 sparked interest in the United States in science education even among elementary school children. In 1958, King Seeley Thermos produced this imaginative box evoking space travel and landings on distant moons and planets. Children provided a receptive audience to this imaginary yet hopeful view of scientific achievement in the early years of the space race. This is one of the few pop culture lunch boxes from the late 1950s not designed around a television show.Jetsons Lunch Box (1963)Aladdin Industries profited from the success of The Jetsons television cartoon series in the fall of 1963 by introducing a domed lunch box featuring that space-traveling suburban family and their robotic maid. American notions of family life in the 1960s traveled effortlessly outward to interplanetary space on this fanciful box.Domed metal lunch boxes traditionally were carried by factory employees and construction workers, but Aladdin and other makers found the curved shape made an excellent young person's landscape, ocean scene, or starry sky. Despite the more earth-bound adult concerns of the Cuban missile crisis of 1962 and the Kennedy assassination, The Jetsons box and bottle showcase the metal lunch box at the zenith of its design life and its popularity among school children.(Found in yesterday's USA Today)See also:Challenge of Outer Space (circa 1950s)The Complete Book of Space Travel (1956)Mars and Beyond (1957)Man and the Moon (1955)",

        "title": "Sports Fans of the Year 2000 (1967)",
        "text": "The August 20, 1967 Progress-Index (Petersburg, VA) ran a piece titled, \"Hard Times Facing Joe Fan,\" about the overcrowding of sports stadiums that was sure to come with exponential population growth.My favorite quote of the article comes from the only source, real estate developer Joseph Timan: \"With unprecedented leisure time on their hands, millions of sports fans will want to patronize more than one team.\"The cartoon at right, reading, \"Bleachers $8,\" appeared in the July 30, 1967 Lima News (Lima, OH) publication of the article. Adjusted for inflation $8 in 1967 is a little over $50 in 2008 currency.NEW YORK (NEA) - It is the year 2000 and you want a ticket to a baseball or a basketball game. You figure it will be just like today, walk up to the box office, push your money over the counter and buy a reserved seat for $2.50. Forget it.This opinion comes from one Joseph Timan, city planner and president of Horizon Land Corp., a real estate development company in Tucson, Ariz.Timan made his prediction following a Horizon-sponsored sociological study of future planning problems in metropolitan areas.The study revealed that city populations are expected to double and triple by the year 2000. This means there will be two to four times more sports fans in the next 30-40 years. Stadium capacity will remain relatively the same.\"Stadiums could be built to seat 150,000\" TIman says, \"but watching a sporting event in a structure this size would be like watching a flea circus from a block away.\"Besides, the crushing chaos of getting this much humanity in and out of such a facility makes management of today's World Series crowds a simple routine by comparison.\"Because of the increased number of fans and the lack of space, tickets, Timan says, will be sold months and in some instances, seasons in advance.\"Even third baseball and football leagues won't meet the demands for tickets,\" Timan said. \"With unprecedented leisure time on their hands, millions of sports fans will want to patronize more than one team.\"To obtain a ticket, the average fan is going to need influence as well as affluence.\"Diamonds, mink and champagne, instead of shirtsleeves and beer, will be commonplace in the bleacher section at ball games,\" Timan continued.\"These sports will no longer be for the masses. The box seats, upper stands and bleachers will be filled up with junior and senior executives - and mostly senior at that. The rest of us will have to be content to see sports over television.\"Prices for a bleacher seat that goes for $2 today will sell for $8 because of the great demand and limited supply. Box seats, for those lucky enough to get them, will bring $20 or more.\"Far fetched?\"Not at all,\" Timan said, \"It's a simple matter to extrapolate from history and project into the future. Consider these facts:\"In the past 30 years the number of fans attending major sporting events have more than tripled while population has increased about 50 per cent.\"Consider salaries of sports greats of 30-40 years ago. Today they're easily four or five time bigger. By 2000 they can be expected to quadruple again.\"Now, larger stadiums are being built, but they are very close to maximum possible size for viewing team sports.\"Thirty years ago bleacher seats were going to 50 cents while they are generally four times this amount today.\"Tickets to many major league football and hockey games are already almost impossible to obtain, unless you have 'pull.' Today just try to get a ticket to a hockey game; a big Saturday college game, or a baseball game when the team is on top.\"Multiply these factors by a doubled or triple urban population by the year 2000, a population with many more upper-income people with more leisure time; couple this with the physical limitations of stadiums, and you can't escape the conclusion that soon there won't be enough stadium seats to go around.\"It sounds like something out of a Walter O'Malley dream.See also:Mile Run in 3:41 by Year 2000 (1965)Lunar High Jump (1979)Sport in Space Colonies (1977)Olympic Games on the Moon in 2020 (1979)Zero-Gravity Football (1981)Future Without Football (Daily Review, 1976)\"Grasshopper\" Golf Cart (1961) ",

        "text": "Planet of the Apes (1968) http://movieposterdb.comBefore it became a magazine, The Futurist was launched as a newsletter in 1967. The second issue was released in April of that year and is filled with some amazing predictions of yestermorrow. The \"cover story,\" if you will, is by Glenn T. Seaborg (the dude who discovered plutonium in 1941) and is titled \"Women and the Year 2000.\"There's a lot to dissect in this piece, and I'm sure we'll look at it in its entirety soon, but I just wanted to share a small section titled \"Intelligent Apes Become Chauffeurs.\" Yeah, you read that right. The RAND Corporation came out with a report that imagined we'd be breeding super-intelligent animals to perform manual labor by the year 2020. It certainly brings to mind this article from 1926 that thought future animals would have to continually justify their existence if they didn't want to become extinct.Oh yeah, and those damn dirty apes.*Intelligent Apes Become ChauffeursFor housewives of the 21st century who prefer animate rather than mechanical domestic servants, there may be a choice other than the robot. About two years ago, the RAND Corporation came out with a Report on a Long Range Forescasting Study (by T. Gordon and Olaf Helmer) which forecasts future developments in a number of important areas. The RAND panel mentioned that by the year 2020 it may be possible to breed intelligent species of animals, such as apes, that will be capable of performing manual labor. During the 21st century, those houses that don't have a robot in the broom closet could have a live-in ape to do the cleaning and gardening chores. Also, the use of well-trained apes as family chauffeurs might decrease the number of automobile accidents. *Note that Planet of the Apes didn't come out until 1968, a year after this prediction was published in The Futurist.

St. Paulite . . . resident of St. Paul, I find the map's indication of \"St. Paul Metro\" pretty hilarious. You see, St. Paul has an inferiority complex due to its big twin brother, Minneapolis, which gets all the national attention. News reports describing the upcoming Republican National Convention in \"Minneapolis\" are about 10 miles off.Tomorrow's map will be vastly different from today's. Great patches over much of it will indicate the super-metropolis cities which are already evolving out of our once-separated urban centers. The \"regional cities\" of tomorrow will be nearly continuous complexes of homes, business centers, factories, shops and service places. Some will be strip or rim cities; some will be star-shaped or finger-shaped; others will be in concentric arcs or parallels; still others will be \"satellite towns\" around a nucleus core. They will be saved from traffic self-suffocation by high-speed transportation - perhaps monorails that provide luxurious nonstop service between the inner centers of the supercities, as well as links between the super-metropolises themselves.See also:Closer Than We Think1980-1990 Developments (1979) ",

Being connected to the internet is but just one thing airline passengers now take for granted as humanity's ability to move from place to place and communicate has not only become easier but, probably most importantly, less expensive.Today we have an image from the April 23, 1967 Independent Press-Telegram (Long Beach, CA) that accompanied an article imagining a \"sea airport\" or Sea Sky Terminal (SST) of the future. Some of the benefits listed in the article appear below.Proponents of the dream terminal say that, among other things, it would:1. Eliminate the danger of huge aircraft landing in congested areas.2. Eliminate the noise associated with major airports.3. Eliminate freeway and street congestion caused by ever-increasing numbers of air travelers trying to get in and out of major terminals.4. Eliminate property problems, such as occurred in Los Angeles recently when that city had to purchase 400 omes in order to make room for a new runway for International Airport.The sea airport of the future, engineers say, could be served by underwater subways and high-speed airfoil vessels. Helicopters, vertical takeoff and landing aircraft and flying buses would link the seagoing airstrip with satellite airports in other cities, by-passing the freeways.Previously on Paleo-Future:Airport of the Future (1967)Fuller's Traveling Cartridge (circa 1960s) ",

Why dress up if you're working from home? Because, of course, Mr. Future Executive lives in a world of videophones!Business, school and play in this retrofuturistic utopia all depend on the highly advanced communications technologies brought to you by Bell Telephone Labs. Documents -- or \"business materials\" as they call them -- are exchanged by \"telephonic machines.\" Lasers transmit phone calls and TV shows from space. Data processing machines... um... process data.Kids get school help from tutors via videophone, wristwatch radio telephones are all the rage with teenagers, and windowshopping becomes that much easier with picturephone.The character design of Talking of Tomorrow instantly reminded me of both the Pink Panther shorts as well as the Rocky and Bullwinkle series. Perhaps someone more educated in animation history can scan the credits and tell us where those connections might be. NOTE: You can watch the video at the AT&amp;T Archives site, but I didn't like how it looked while embedded, so I ripped my own copy from the DVD set of Invaders from Space and Atomic Rulers.",

The piece can be read in its entirety at Michael Pollan's own site.When I was a kid growing up in the early 60's, anybody could have told you exactly what the future of food was going to look like. We'd seen \"The Jetsons,\" toured the 1964 World's Fair, tasted the culinary fruits (or at least fruit flavors) of the space program, and all signs pointed to a single outcome: the meal in a pill, washed down, perhaps, with next-generation Tang.The general consensus seemed to be that \"food\"—a word that was already beginning to sound old-fashioned—was destined to break its surly bonds to Nature, float free of agriculture and hitch its future to Technology. If not literally served in a pill, the meal of the future would be fabricated \"in the laboratory out of a wide variety of materials,\" as one contemporary food historian predicted, including not only algae and soybeans but also petrochemicals. Protein would be extracted directly from fuel oil and then \"spun and woven into 'animal' muscle—long wrist-thick tubes of 'fillet steak.' \"See also:Just Imagine (1930)That Synthetic Food of the Future (Ogden Standard-Examiner, 1926)Food of the Future (Indiana Progress, 1896)Delicious Waste Liquids of the Future (1982)1999 A.D.

Ehrlich stipulated that, \"...none of [the scenarios] will come true as stated, but they describe the kinds of disasters that will occur as mankind slips into the famine decades.\"\"In 1972 news of the war in Thailand occupies the headlines of the United States, China has catastrophic floods, a breakdown of communications, and massive famines. Increasingly serious food riots in China, India, and Brazil are a matter of great concern to the Central Intelligence Agency.\"\"In early January, 1973, large numbers of Chinese troops move into the Thai conflict for the first time. They receive tactical air support from bases in North Vietnam.\"\"After an unheeded warning, tactical nuclear weapons are used in strikes on selected Chinese air bases, supply complexes, and staging areas in North Vietnam, Thailand, and southern China. With the connivance of the Russians a preemptive strike is also launched against China's nuclear facilities. Unfortunately, our defenses are not sufficient to prevent five 'dirty' Chinese thermo-nuclear devices, transported in submarines, from being detonated in the sea off our West Coast. Fallout results in more than 100 million American deaths.\"If you thought Scenario 1 was incredible stay tuned for Scenarios 2 and 3.",

        "text": "Continuing our look into the future as presented by Paul Ehrlichin in his 1968 book The Population Bomb, today we examine his second scenario. Due to what Ehrlich believed to be over-population and inevitable famine the world has digressed into utter chaos. Again, this is excerpted from the 1970 edition of the book.\"In 1979 the last non-Communist government in Latin America, that of Mexico, is replaced by a Chinese-supported military junta.\"\"Only the outbreak of a particularly virulent strain of bubonic plague killing 65% of the starving Egyptian population had averted a direct Soviet-American clash in the Mediterranean.\"\"The third Los Angeles killer smog in two years has wiped out 90,000 people....The President's Environmental Advisory Board has reported a measurable rise in the sea level due to melting polar ice caps. [The Board] recommends the immediate compulsory restriction of births to one per couple, and compulsory sterilization of all persons with I.Q. scores under 90.\"\"Pollution and pesticide poisonings have supplanted cardio-vascular disease as the number one killer of Americans.\"\"[In early 1980] general thermonuclear war ensues. Particularly devastating are the high altitude 'flash' devices designed to set fire to all flammable materials over huge areas. At one point 15 monster fires rage in the Northern Hemisphere. Each covers an average area of 400,000 square miles - four times the area of Colorado.\"\"[Radiation levels] make two-thirds of the Earth uninhabitable. Pollution of the sea is vastly increased. Small pockets of Homo sapiens hold on for a while in the Southern Hemisphere, but slowly die out as social systems break down, radiation poisoning takes effect, climatic changes kill crops, livestock dies off, and various man-made plagues spread. The most intelligent creatures ultimately surviving this period are cockroaches.\"See also:The Population Bomb: Scenario 1 (1970) 12 March 2007",

        "text": "It is a fitting day to look at Paul Ehrlich's third and final scenario of agri-apocalypse from his 1968 book, The Population Bomb.Today Norman Borlaug, probably the greatest living American, received the Congressional Gold Medal. Mr. Bourlag received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1970 after becoming an integral figure in the \"Green Revolution.\"While Paul Ehrlich was advocating forced birth control and spiking foreign food aid with antifertility drugs, Norman Borlaug was figuring out how to literally save a billion people using technology.Below are excerpts from Ehrlich's third nightmare scenario. Ehrlich thought it would get so bad so quickly that the Pope would give his blessing to abortion by 1974.In 1974 the United States government finally realizes that the food-population balance in much of Asia, Africa, and South America is such that most areas cannot attain self-sufficiency. American expeditionary forces are withdrawn from Vietnam and Thailand, and the United States announces it will no longer send food to India, Egypt, and some other countries which it considers beyond hope. A moderate food rationing program is instituted in the United States. It further announces that food production in the United States will be increased only so long as the increase can be accomplished without damage to the environment of the North American continent. Pope Pius XIII, yielding to pressure from enlightened Catholics, announces that all good Catholics have a responsibility to drastically restrict their productive activities. He gives his blessing to abortion and all methods of contraception. Several cheap, long-term anticonception drugs are developed and made available for wide distribution.Famine and plague sweep the Arab world, which, in the face of Russia's growing disinterest, is forced to seek peace and cooperation with Israel. Israel, in grave economic trouble, installs a peace government and begins negotiations. Most of the countries of Africa and South America slide backward into famine and local warfare. Many adopt Communistic governments, but few are able to achieve any stability.Ehrlich ends the chapter by callously calling the third scenario an appealing one even though it \"presumes the death by starvation of perhaps as many as half a billion people, one-fifth of the world's population.\" Enhrlich then challenges the reader to devise a scenario more optimistic than the last and writes that he \"won't accept one that starts, 'In early 1972 the first monster space ships from a planet of the star Alpha Centauri arrive bearing CARE packages . . .'\"How about a scenario that starts with, \"In 1942 a young man named Norman Borlaug received his Ph.D. in plant pathology and genetics and decided to help save a billion human lives.\"See also:The Population Bomb: Scenario 1 (1970)The Population Bomb: Scenario 2 (1970)",

Who knows but what future generation from some other planet will dig down through seven layers of rubble and find us some 2,000 years hence, and crowd around a museum glass containing a broken fragment of a Coca Cola bottle, a bent hairpin and a parched copy of our Bible which managed to escape the terrifying destruction of civilization!

With historic blizzards, closed schools and caved in stadiums it sounds like the snowy season has been off to a punishing start in my homeland. It's times like these when I gaze at my \"What Would Arthur Radebaugh Do?\" bracelet. Burn the snow, of course! Kill it with fire!Snow piles and drifts on highways and turnpikes may soon be a thing of the past. Esso Research and Engineering Company has already devised a system for clearing urban roadways that is reported to be cheaper than under-pavement steam or electric coils. A trough is built alongside the road and kept half-filled with water which is heated by oil and air fed units at the bottom. Snow channeled into the trough melts instantly.Variations of this system can be evolved for cross-country roads. Flame-belching snow-melting highway equipment is even now on the drawing boards.Next week: Circle RunwaysMany thanks to Tom Z. for the color version of this Closer Than We Think panel from January 3, 1960.

        "text": "While visiting New York a few years ago I stopped in at the Paley Center for Media (formerly the Museum of Television and Radio). They have quite an extensive collection of TV programs that anyone can view, two at a time, for an admission fee. One of the shows I watched was an episode of the CBS show, The 21st Century hosted by Walter Cronkite. Titled \"At Home, 2001\" the episode aired on March 12, 1967 and is a wonderfully retrofuturistic artifact that shows off the technological advancements of a house in the future. The house featured in this episode will look familiar to those who've watched the 1967 Philco-Ford promotional film, 1999 A.D. According to Cronkite, the home of the year 2001 will feature inflatable furniture, push-button kitchens, computers for educating Junior at home, and enormous TV screens. The episode talks to a handful of experts, including Philip Johnson who -- as we know from this radio documentary from 1966 -- wasn't terribly optimisitc for the future of innovation. Cronkite himself lived to see the first decade of the 21st century. I wish I'd been able to interview him about some of the changes he'd seen.An excerpt from the March 12, 1967 edition of the Pasadena Independent Star-News appears below.The home of tomorrow is the subject of \"At Home, 2001\" on The 21st Century, in color Sunday at 6:00 PM on CBS.CBS News Correspondent Walter Cronkite is the reporter.The broadcast will explore the promise of modern technology, architecture and city planning, as well as new ways of doing things in the home. Robots may help with housework. The kitchen might resemble a laboratory where cooking might be done in seconds by high-energy sound waves. The man of the house could conduct much of his business at home by electronic devices. The children of the 21st Century might be educated at home by a computer.Whether tomorrow's home will be a thing of beauty, a tasteless suburban tract or a high-rise beehive also will be examined. Whatever it is, it is estimated that some 60 million homes will be built before the year 2001.Longtime readers of Paleofuture might recall that we looked at another episode of The 21st Century a few years ago. titled the \"Mystery of Life\" that asked some hard questions about science's role in reproduction. In the episode, James Bonner argues that eugenics is the only way to breed out the undesirable traits in humanity, while Harrison Brown asks how things like \"undesirable\" might be defined.",

Most of these issues, as we've seen in earlier posts, involve figuring out what we're going to do with our abundant free-time. Won't people get tremendously bored, only working three days per week? You bet your sweet jetpack they will.This clip of the radio program transitions from what to do with your free-time into what we'll do to control the weather. Can't have mother nature messing up our extravagant vacations now, can we?If we have all this leisure, for loafing or not, we'll be at the mercy of the weather. Or, will it be the other way around? My estimate is that we will start to work seriously to modify thunderclouds to reduce lightning. I think that we'll be able to have some sort of estimate of whether we can control tornadoes and such local severe storms. I think that we will not try to modify weather on a very large scale yet by that time simply because the ramifications will be of such a nature that we would run into considerable political or international difficulties.See also:2000 A.D.

The future is forseeable. Unless, as Orwell cautioned, we anticipate future problems, begin the search for alternative solutions, and stake a claim on our long-term future, we may lose what it has to offer.\"However, like any book of futuristic projections we quickly get to the fanciful visions. And let's be honest, would you read this blog without the spectacle of absurd, often wrong, predictions? Stick around, because 1994 was a much cooler year than any of us ever knew.",

Though the continued spread of RFID chips makes such an idea more plausible today, the future kitchen isn't yet quite what we imagined.A January 3, 1977 piece in the Winnipeg Free Press (Winnipeg, Manitoba) predicted the smart cupboard, kitchen computers that automatically select menus and kitchen televisions for monitoring Junior in the next room. The piece appears in its entirety below.TORONTO (CP) - The housewife of the future will be able to keep an eye on her sleeping baby by \"dialing in\" the nursery to get an instant picture of a kitchen television screen.This is but one prediction Canadians can expect to come true as advances in kitchen conveniences are researched and developed, says Gordon I. Forsell, vice-president of marketing and sales for Inglis Ltd., appliance manufacturer.\"We visualize a day when a central panel or brain will allow the housewife to handle most tasks through a computerized source,\" said Mr. Forsell.A kitchen computer will select menus and deliver frozen items directly from freezer to micro-wave oven. A gourmet meal may be thawed, cooked and ready-to-serve in minutres.The computer's brain will store information such as a tally of supplies that are running short in the kitchen cupboard.Mr. Forsell predicted that the same television screen the housewife watchers her baby on will deliver the day's news or a special college course at the push of a button.Located centrally in the kitchen of tomorrow is the cooking area, he said. Smooth, unbroken cooking surfaces that wife clean with a cloth will be hidden beneath the kitchen counter ready to pull out and use when required.He said a giant crisper located directly beside the sink area will keep greens fresh and well within reach. Its moisture will be automatically controlled.Mr. Forsell said a special sink will be equipped with a food dispenser so that peels and rinds will disappear. \"And paper, cans and other solid waste products will go into a trash compactor,\" he said.\"Also built into the kitchen of tomorrow is a year-round herb garden supported by ultra-violet light.\"He said that no one will have to wash a dish, plate or pot.\"New dishwashers will add their own detergents, adjust heat automatically and handle every utensil efficiently,\" he said. \"The dishwasher will be hidden below the counter and programmed to rise to counter top at the push of a button.\"\"Mr. Forsell said the kitchen of the future also will have a complete laundry centre. Programmed washers will automatically sort fabrics and colors including all the touch double-knits and delicate laces. Previously on Paleo-Future:1999 A.D. (1967)Will Robots Make People Obsolete?

This excerpt, from page 71, illustrates the lack of imagination we often have when it comes to technology and thinking exponentially:\"Computers will benefit even more than telephones from the development of integrated circuits in ever smaller 'chips', and very small computers may emerge. Most computers will probably still occupy a large room, however, because of the space needed for the ancillary software - the tapes and cards to be fed in, the operating staff, and the huge piles of paper for printing out the results.

She orders up a week's worth of low-calorie menus. Within micro-seconds, the machine devises such meal plans. Then it prints them.Before she entered the kitchen, Mrs. Doe stopped briefly in the living room to admire the family's newest possession - a huge geometric print, drawn by computer.As she goes about her chores, she is relaxed by the sounds of her favorite record, Computer Concerto. This features a musical score created by computer and orchestrated by computer. The sounds are electronic. There are blips and beeps and modulated static.At times the sounds blend noises of a dozen jets waiting on the runway to takeoff. Altogether, it is a pleasant record.In the afternoon, Mrs. Doe goes to her small town's medical center for her annual physical. Among other things, she has an electrocardiogram - administered by technicians, processed by computer and read, of course, by computer.The printout on her eletrocardiogram: \"Non specific T-wave changes. Possibly borderline gram. Probably within normal limits.\"All of these things from the world of computers were seen at an unconventional convention in New York - the 25th National Conference of the Association for Computing Machinery.They will come home to roost in the not-too-distant future. You probably won't have to wait until the year 2,000, for example, to have computer art and music in your home. Hospitals of the land already are experimenting with diagnosis by computer.The menu - planning computer for the kitchen, while a bit expensive around $10,000, is available. It is designed to help keep track of financial records, lend a hand with the children's homework - and perform many other tasks.After Radiohead's Amnesiac was released, friends and I would joke that their next record would be nothing but airplane noises. I would actually be interested in hearing that Computer Concerto record. See also:1999 A.D.

        "text": "The 1970s was a tough decade for America. As we saw in the second episode of paleofuture.tv, many people were predicting apocalypse. But in 1976, it seems Americans were determined to hold their heads up high and celebrate 200 years of a country that was experiencing some major growing pains. If there's one thing Americans know how to do well, it's throw a party. And the U.S. Bicentennial was supposed to be one hell of a party.On July 4, 1976 newspapers all across America dedicated special sections to the history and future of the country. The Grand Prairie Daily News in Grand Pairie, Texas invited readers to write letters to the people of 2076, who would presumably be celebrating the United States Tricentennial. Today we have some of those letters from high school students of the year 1976. What's pretty clear in reading the letters is that even most high school kids weren't very optimistic about what the next hundred years had in store for them.[I've redacted the number that appears under Mike Sharp's letter because it looks like a Social Security number. I'm not sure why Mike would include his Social Security number, but I'd rather not create any unnecessary problems for ol' Mike, because most of these people are probably alive today.]The drawing above was made by little Lisa Givlar in 1976 and appeared in The Tricentennial Report.  Dear People of the Year 2076,In the year 2076, the world will be far ahead in space travel and modern technalogy. There will be space flights to other planets.Machines will take over, modern man will become a living blobb.California will not be on the map and the weather will change through out the world.Hungar will strike Asia and Europe. The civilization of 2076 will depend upon the polluted sea waters for food.Nuclear enery will supply our needs.Population control will be put into affect. The world will be over populous.Schools wll be television programs. This may all seem funny to you but I remember a time when space travel was all just a dream. Earthling,Pat Bentley  To the people of the year 2076,In a hundred years I think the world will be overpopulated and people will have to live in apartments to accomodate for this. Everything will be able to be recycled and what little that can't will be shot out into space. FromGreg Redding Many things will change some good some bad. But most of all I hope that the people of the year 2076 still love and protect the United States and what it stands for. This world is tough, but I am glad to be born in a place such as America were I can say what I please. Sincerely,A South Grand Prairie High Warrior[unreadable] Allen  I believe 100 years from now, (\"1976\") the year I graduate, crime will be wiped out completely. There will be some kind of magnetic force field to stop anyone from doing something illeagle.Someday in the future I hope the world will not need army's, but I doubt that day will come. There will be new weapons being built all the time. I feel that the wars will be push button wars not on the battefield with hand-to-hand combat.We probably have traveled to new planets and had started new colonies. Concerts and music is something important in my life, but I doubt it will be in the future.I hope the world is at peace, and I wish all of you Americans the best of luck. Mike Sharp To: Whomever,I'm suppose to write what I think the world will be like in 100 years. Well, honestly, I doubt if the world will even exist. The earth will probably destroy itself by then with a nuclear war.The people of today just can't get along together, or even seem to be trying. But if by some miracle, and it would be a miracle, man still exists 100 years from now, I'm hoping the world will be a peaceful place. Maybe man will have learned to live in harmony with nature. Instead of polluting the air and sea. Maybe all the countries of the world will destroy their weapons and love their fellow man. This would be a great accomplisment and I'm wishing you all the luck in the world. Maura McDonald There is one thing specifically I would not like to see in the year 2076 and that is war and hostility of any kind. Peace is an all important thing the people of Earth must learn in order to progress and survive.I truly wish humanity knows what to do with itself. Spirit of 76 Bi CentennialYours trulyBobby Jack ",

        "text": "Carl T. Rowan wrote a piece which appeared in the July 3, 1976 Stevens Point Daily Journal (Stevens Point, WI) titled, \"Sees hatred yet a century hence.\"Rowan covers issues of racism, eugenics and elitism in the century leading up to the United States tricentennial. The piece appears below in its entirety.GALAXY SPACE STATION (July 4, 2076) - At least 120 children and a spaceship driver were laser-beamed to death yesterday when Galaxians resorted to violence to try to prevent the spaceshipping of school children here from the predominantly black Stardust Space Station a few thousand miles away. The above may strike you as a highly unlikely news story to mark the celebration of America's tricentennial. But it sums up what I see as I honor a request from Portland, Ore., that I look into my crystal ball and peek at human relations a century from now.The people of 2076 (if any survive) will have made scientific progress so incredible that millions will have liberated themselves from Mother Earth and her finite resources such as water, food, petroleum, coal. But they will only prove that while humans get smarter they don't grow wiser.Those who become the new pioneers, seeking a richer life on space stations beyond our polluted atmosphere, will be burdened by hatreds, prejudices and fears as old-fashioned as those that bedeviled Americans in the days of Jefferson Davis and Harriet Beecher Stowe.Racism, chauvinism, snobbery, greed will still dominate human affairs despite incredible developments in genetic engineering - plus chemicals and new surgical techniques designed to control the intellect, and modify the behavior, personality and mood of 21st century man and woman.The truth is that, in seeking to alter genes, chromosomes and every other basic element of human life so as to create a super race - and who is superior intellectually, morally, physically. Those deemed inferior will find their families doomed to vanish in one generation. By 2076 only the elite will be permitted to procreate, and even then under carefully monitored circumstances.Blacks wound up predominant on the Stardust Space Station, in fact, having escaped to this outer-space refuge when rumors spread that genetic engineers had ordered the extinction of all the \"inferior blacks.\" According to the descendants of a couple of 20th century \"scholars,\" William Shockley and Arthur Jensen, blacks and other \"minorities\" were pulling down the intellectual quality of the whole human race.Remember, now, this is the crystal ball reporting.Believe me, if I could influence the crystal ball I'd show you a 2076 society in which people ranging in color from goat's milk to double chocolate finally find mutuality of respect and a sense of love that gives them a kind of security no cruise missiles and B-1 bombers will ever provide.But every time I shake my crystal ball and say, \"Don't be absurd! Even a species as dumb as homo sapiens will find a way to free itself from bigotry in 100 years,\" that crystal ball flashes backwards two or three centuries to prove otherwise. I see Christians and Moslems killing each other, as now. And Germans and Frenchmen in conflict generation after generation. And Catholics and Protestants in brutal conflict that no passage of time erases in places like Northern Ireland. The Jew-haters of a millennium ago sounding just like Spiro Agnew. Racial violence in Boston in 1976 arising from passions of bigotry no less intense than those that spawned a riot in Wilmington, N.C., 78 years earlier, or in Atlanta 70 years before.That crystal ball keeps contradicting all sorts of things that I have written. More than 24 years ago, in my preface to \"South of Freedom,\" I wrote; \"I do not believe that man was born to hate and be hated; I cannot believe that the race problem is an inevitable concomitant of democratic life.\"That crystal ball flashes into 2076 and tells me that in 1951, or is it that I [now] have an old crystal ball which is disillusioned, clouded with pessimism, unable to see man's potential for rising up next to the angels?See also:Future Shock - Skin Color (1972)The Tricentennial Report: Letters from America (1977)Lisa's Picture of 2076 (1976)Tricentennial Report Ad (Oakland Tribune, 1976)Animals of 2076 (1977)21st Century Eugenics (1967) ",

With colonies in space, solar heated houses, amazing sports, (which obviously take place in freefall), and wristwatch TV it's almost too much for just one blog to handle, but we shall try. Stay tuned for more as we crack this book wide open in the coming weeks.A special thanks to JesseM for turning me on to this book series after reading my post about the EPCOT book The Future World of Transporation.",

A special \"futurology\" class at suburban Milford Junior High School also figured the next century will mean bigger government control over more people, a solution to air pollution and new mass transit systems.The 17 \"gifted students\" at Milford reached their conclusions after interviewing government and research firm officials, visiting universities and taking several other field trips. Four teachers who helped design the course also are writing a group PhD thesis about the experience.Student group projects included models of an underwater city, a 21st century home, airport and school. One group designed a 21st century game to be played by two persons in a small cubicle to save space.\"Football won't exist because space will be short,\" said teacher Ronald Herbers. In explaining to parents what the \"futurology\" project was about, the teachers explained, \"We hope to help them (students) see that the future is not uncontrollable.\"See also:Sport in Space Colonies (1977)Olympic Games on the Moon in 2020 (1979)",

        "title": "Fuzzy-Duzzy, The Computer You Cuddle (1976)",
        "text": "The August, 1976 issue of The Futurist magazine ran this blurb about the need for humanized machines, which would make technology less intimidating for the average user. The piece appears to have originally appeared in Hal Hellman's 1976 book Technophobia: Getting Out of the Technology Trap.We need \"humanized machines.\" Wes Thomas, editor of the future-oriented newsletter Synergy Access and a computer expert, once told me of a \"dream\" he has. \"What I'd like to do,\" he said, \"is develop computer systems that are more 'human,' that people are not afraid of, in fact that they would get along with and even enjoy.\" He would like, therefore, to develop the \"Fuzzy-Duzzy.\"Today, he explains, computer terminals are made out of metal and plastic. They are cold and uninviting; therefore most people are immediately turned off by them. And they look menacing, like something a mad scientist would create.With Fuzzy-Duzzy, he says, \"you would put your hands into this warm, inviting Teddy-Bear thing, and you would be able to look inside through a porthole. Inside there would be these big knobs you could get hold of and turn, instead of the usual miniature keys everybody keeps making mistakes on. By moving things around, you'd be able to communicate with the machine.\"And the pictures that come on the screen would not be the usual angular shapes, but nice, round organic forms.\"So I'm interested in developing a sort of organic computer terminal that people will feel at home with immediately.\"When I mentioned this to an acquaintance, he became furious. He called it underhanded, meretricious, and worse. A machine has no right being \"friendly.\"Thomas's \"dream\" is a bit extreme, I will admit. Yet humanized machines combined with people who are not afraid of them (and who understand where and how to use them) may be the way we will eventually do many of the things that remain to be done in basic education and job training, in health care and perhaps in many other applications as well. Just as the supermarket put the customer to work, so too may it be necessary for patients and prospective patients to do some of the pre-entry work themselves, aided by computers - humanized ones, of course.Machines will also help us provide sight for the blind and hearing for the deaf, mobility for the lame and dexterity for the handicapped. Will humanization of such machines be necessary too?",

Since few serious prognosticators believe that any of these \"medical wonders\" will actually occur in the near future, let's take a look at what we can realistically expect to see in 1994:- The practice of medicine directed toward the prevention, rather than the treatment, of infectious diseases.- Health insurance for every American.- Vaccinations to immunize children against rheumatic fever.- The control, perhaps the prevention,  of hypertension by new drugs and chemicals.- Intensive coronary care units in all hospitals for the treatment of acutely ill patients. (The American Heart Association estimates that such facilities could save some 50,000 heart patients who now die each year.)- Detection and removal of blood clots before they produce damage from heart attack or stroke.- Vaccines to prevent the venereal diseases of gonorrhea and syphilis.- A vaccine to prevent tooth decay.- Routine lung and liver transplants.- More sophisticated drug treatment for epilepsy.- \"Medical cities,\" resembling sprawling shopping centers, consisting of high-rise hospital buildings surrounded by parking areas and garages.- Most doctors employed full time at medical center complexes, and more physicians trained as specialists.- Development of drugs for the successful treatment of some cancers.The prediction of universal health insurance for Americans is obviously the most politically contentious issue on the list. I wonder what kind of support the idea had in 1973 compared with today.See also:1994: The World of Tomorrow (1973)",

Because if we've learned anything at the Paleo-Future blog, it's that kids are stupid.We'll begin by looking at letters by young Laurie Smith, Yolanda Tejeda, and R.C. Brown. These kids really hit all the major futurism topics of the 20th century: robot maids, moving sidewalks, flying cars, meal pills, push button everything, education through television, socialism, and candy. Lots of candy. Dear Janice,In the year 2000 I think that cars can fly in the air as fast as they want to without using gas. You can get whatever you want, including candy. Houses will be way up in the sky. You can have robots to do the housework for the mothers. Instead of walking, the the sidewalks will move for you.Your friend,Laurie Smith Dear John,In the year 2000 I think thay kids will be taught at home on their T.V. The army will be using lazor guns. Cars will be like spaceships and the strreetlights will be on long tall poles. Another means of transportation will be push buttons. Select where you want to go, push a button, step through a door, and you'll be where you wanted to be.Food will be in tablet form, put on water on the tablet and your food will be on your plate.Sincerely yours,R.C. Brown Dear Laurie,I think in the year 2000 the earth will be much more polluted than it is.I also think that we will have no more school, and cars can go as fast as they want without getting a ticket.The government will pay every person as much as they want without them having to work. I also think we will be out of energy for stores or anything that uses fuel in the year 2000.Sincerely,Yolanda Tejeda Previously on Paleo-Future:Stupid Kids Imagine the Year 2075 (1975)Lisa's Picture of 2076 (1976)The Predictions of a 14-Year-Old (Milwaukee Excelsior, 1901)More Predictions of a 14-Year-Old (1901) ",

Giant-size TV. Based on the designs already available, this one has a super-bright screen for daylight viewing and stereo sound system.2. Electronic video movie camera, requires no film, just a spool of tape. Within ten years video cameras like this could be replaced by 3-D holographic recorders.3. Flat screen TV. No longer a bulky box, TV has shrunk to a thickness of less than five centimetres. This one is used to order shopping via a computerised shopping centre a few kilometres away. The system takes orders and indicates if any items are not in stock.4. Video disc player used for recording off the TV and for replaying favourite films.5. Domestic robot rolls in with drinks. One robot, the Quasar, is already on sale in the USA. Reports indicate that it may be little more than a toy however, so it will be a few years before 'Star Wars' robots tramp through our homes.6. Mail slot. By 1990, most mail will be sent in electronic form. Posting a letter will consist of placing it in front of a copier in your home or at the post office. The electronic read-out will be flashed up to a satellite, to be beamed to its destination. Like many other electronic ideas, the savings in time and energy could be enormous.The picture [above] takes you into the living room of a house of the future. The basics will probably be similar - windows, furniture, carpet and TV. There will be one big change though - the number of electronic gadgets in use.The same computer revolution which has resulted in calculators and digital watches could, through the 1980s and '90s, revolutionise people's living habits.Television is changing from a box to stare at into a useful two-way tool. Electronic newspapers are already available - pushing the button on a handset lets you read 'pages' of news, weather, puzzles and quizzes.TV-telephones should be a practical reality by the mid 1980s. Xerox copying over the telephone already exists. Combining the two could result in millions of office workers being able to work at home if they wish. There is little need to work in a central office if a computer can store records, copiers can send information from place to place and people can talk on TV-telephones.Many people may prefer to carry on working in an office with others, but for those who are happy at home, the savings in travelling time would be useful. Even better would be the money saved on transport costs to and from work.See also:Future Cities: Homes and Living into the 21st Century (1979)Closer Than We Think!

I then realized that the athletes don't need the same type of protection.A reoccurring element of the paleo-future is the expectation of superfluous design. That is to say, we make things appear different and beautiful because we can. With a few design modifications the utility vehicle could be much more practical, but where's the fun in that? I guess that's why we fall in love with the future and why dystopian images are that much more jarring.This image is featured in the 1979 book Future Cities: Homes and Living into the 21st Century (World of the Future) which is a volume in the compilation book The Usborne Book of the Future: A Trip in Time to the Year 2000 and Beyond.See also:Olympic Games on the Moon in 2020 (1979)Sea City 2000 (1979)Future Cities: Homes and Living into the 21st Century (1979)Ristos (1979)The Future World of Transportation",

        "text": "Readers of Penthouse magazine were treated to a special \"Science and the Future\" issue in October of 1978, which acted as a sort of coming out party for OMNI magazine. OMNI, \"a magazine of science, science fiction and the future,\" was launched in October, 1978 by Kathy Keeton, the future wife of Penthouse publisher Bob Guccione.The issue included an article on robot rights, fiction by Anthony Burgess about the decline of the British Empire in 1985, hilarious 70's fashion photography of the future, a look at six different car designs of the year 2001, and a nine page preview of what makes OMNI the \"first magazine of the 21st century.\"As a gentleman of the post-print pornography generation, I can't say that I'm terribly familiar with Penthouse. But this issue looks like pretty standard fare with a sci-fi twist; naked women [dressed as aliens] in provocative poses, hokey cartoons, and those infamous Penthouse letters. I never thought anything futuristic like this would ever happen to me but... SPACE: the final, full-frontal frontier... the last hurrah... to go where no man has ever gone before, the forbidden and yet insidiously alluring planet of NYMPHON in the second quadrant of PHI DELTA PUBIS, hard by the tumescent moons of GLUTEON MAXIMUS. It was here that I said good-bye to an intrepid friend, a great lady, whose heaving decks and smoldering afterburners had served me well -- the Yenta Prize, peripatetic mistress of the cosmic seas. I beamed down... down into the swirling, choking vapors that envelop NYMPHON, down to the very floor of this curious planet where, unused to the dense, jellylike atmosphere, I passed out.The Star Wars cartoon below certainly reminds me of this article from 1928 about robot lovers of the future.

In [the] future we may have robot servants to do all the jobs in the home. In charge of tomorrow's servants will be a robot brain. It will run the house. It will control other machines electronically. The brain will work vacuum cleaners, lawn mowers, washing machines, food mixers, automatic cookers and other gadgets.We will be able to give the brain its orders, telling it what jobs to do and when to do them. If we forget to mow the lawn, the robot brain will remind us. Then we can tell the robot to get on with the job.There may be walking robots to do the dusting, and to lay and clear the table. The robots in the picture are real. One is called Quasar. Quasar can vacuum carpets, mow lawns, carry trays of food, and even take the dog for a walk! At the door is another robot, called the Maid Without Tears.One day people may not go out to work at all. They will work from home, using television and robots. The robot brain will suggest meals for the day. It will order our shopping, finding out from other robots in the local shops where the best buys are. The goods will be packed and delivered to our home by robots.See also:Robots: The World of the Future (1979)Living Room of the Future (1979)In a Cashless Future, Robots Will Cook (1996)Closer Than We Think!

With energy crises, fears of terrorism and skyrocketing unemployment, it's really no wonder that Americans of the 1970s were often pessimistic about the future. Out of this dread, the apocsploitation film was born. Movies like Future Shock and The Late Great Planet Earth served up apocalyptic visions of the American future, both secular and religious. The second episode of paleofuture.tv looks at the doomsday documentary films of this era, which strangely enough all seemed to be hosted by Orson Welles.

        "text": "Most people of the 20th century imagined humanoid robots as the domestic servants of the future. But one curious article from the March 1, 1974 Record-Eagle (Traverse City, MI) described the year 2000 as a world of cyborg Fidos awaiting your next command; be it closing the window, or bombing an insurgent hideout. LONDON (UPI) -- The programming of family pets to perform various tasks and various deeds, good or evil as required, may be fairly common practice by the year 2000, according to an American psychologist.Dr. Boris Levinson of Touro College in New York, a specialist on relationships between people and animals, said that by the end of the century pets controlled by brain electrodes may become commonplace. Recent experiments make this a strong probability, he said.\"it does not lie in the realm of science fiction,\" Dr. Levinson told a symposium organized by the British Small Animals' Veterinary Association. \"In a sense the electrodes will make the animals become living robots. They will be able to open doors, close windows, adjust beds and even call for help.\"He said pets could even be used for warfare and for espionage and if the knowledge of genetic engineering involved fell into the hands of insurgent groups they could be employed in bombings and in plane hijackings. Criminals might use them in the commission of theft, robbery and even murder.But he said most pets would play a highly beneficial role in society -- \"a very important safety valve in a sick society\" -- as specially trained companions to invalids, old people, childless couples and even astronauts.Dr. Levinson's remarks brought quick reactions in this nation of animal lovers. A spokesman for the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and other animal lovers described \"exploitation\" of pets as reprehensible. Dr. Levinson pointed out that dogs had been used as living bombs in the Russo-German fighting in World War II an he was stating the possibilities.\"We can already implant minute electrodes into animals' brains to make them placid, angry or to stop them attacking,\" he said. \"It is only a matter of time before electrodes can be implanted into every part of the brain to make them do whatever we wish.\" Previously on Paleo-Future:Newton the Household Robot (1989)The Future of Personal Robots (1986)Elektro and Sparko Ad (1956)Robot Christmas (1958)Will Robots Make People Obsolete?

        "text": "The 1976 book Future Facts is filled with predictions of artificial life, underwater cities and traveling from New York to Los Angeles in 21 minutes. Though the last excerpted line is pretty hilarious, this prediction of the \"portaphone\" of the future is surprisingly accurate.A hand-held, completely portable telephone will make it possible to place calls while riding in a bus, walking down the street or sitting in a restaurant. Developed by Motorola, Inc., the first \"portaphone\" system will be installed in New York City by 1976.The portaphone looks like a fat Princess phone or a high-fashion walkie-talkie. Weighing less than three pounds, the unit can dial and receive calls anywhere within FM signal range of the system's computer-controlled receivers.As the caller talks over the portaphone, his voice is radioed to the nearest receiver. The signal is relayed into a central computer, then fed into conventional telephone lines. The computer can track the speaker as he moves about the city, switching the conversation to different receivers to maintain a loud and clear connection.A portable phone user can contact any conventional or portable phone. The initial cost will be $60 to $100 per month, but as the market demand increases, the costs are expected to go down.The FCC has proposed 115 MHz of spectrum including channels 73 through 88 for two-way applications. Portaphone will probably operate in that frequency range.Each telephone has a pushbutton keyboard; it's dialed like a conventional pushbutton phone.Motorola sees a bright future for the portaphone: \"We expect there'll be heavy usage by a widely diverse group of people -- businessmen, journalists, doctors, housewives, virtually anyone who needs or wants telephone communications in areas where conventional telephones are unavailable.\"For a while at least, the portaphone will remain a business tool or luxury item. In time, however, portaphones will get smaller and cheaper, just as transistor radios have.One day you'll call almost anyone, anywhere. You could have instantaneous contact with your doctor or the police. People might be brought closer together than ever before -- with the potential to be in voice contact with others.

So will the electric car. The service-free, accident-proof automobile is expected to be in widespread use by the year 2000.Ditto for  automated urban transit, after becoming technologically possible in 1985 and economically feasible 10 years later.Also by 1995, aerospace experts predict an economic alternative to petroleum fuel and full use of it by 2010.See also:The Futurists of 1966 Looking Toward A.D. 2000Health Care in 1994 (1973)Headlines of the Near Future (1972)Closer Than We Think!

The book contains other illustrations of space colonies but we've already looked at them here.NASA pictures a space colony that humans could buildin 22 years. Shaped like a wheel, it has room for 10,000 people inside. It circles Earth 250,000 miles out in space - as far away as the moon! The structure keeps spinning to create artificial gravity inside.The space colony has its own air sealed in tight against space. It carries its own water supply, which can be cleaned and used over and over again. Sunshine provides light and power. A large turning paddle helps remove heat that is not needed.Babies will be born, children will go to school, and adults will work in the space colony. It will have homes, schools, hospitals, and stores. Farms will provide plants and animals for food. There will be factories where clothes and other necessities will be made.If we started this project right away, humans could have a colony in space soon after the year 2000!Previously on Paleo-Future:Vacation at a Space Hotel (1982)Space Colony Pirates (1981)Factories in Space (1982)Sport in Space Colonies (1977)Colonies in Space (1987)Space Spiders (1979)Space Colonies by Don DavisMore Space Colony Art (1970s)",

        "text": "On August 22, 1975 The News (Frederick, Maryland) ran an article titled, \"Space colony possible,\" which advocated the building of a space city. Below are excerpts from the piece.A $100 billion city in space that would house 10,000 people and beam solar energy to earth could be a reality within 20 years, according to a select team of scholars.The scholars said a space colony, once built, could transmit limitless solar energy to earth 24 hours a day.As envisioned, the space colony would resemble a mile-wide wheel and have 10,000 inhabitants living in the outer rim. The vessel would orbit between the earth and moon, some 280,000 miles out in space.Food for all residents would grow on 111 acres, with crops bathed in continuous sunlight. To maintain gravity similar to earth's, the craft would make one complete revolution every minute.Residents would have a half-mile long landscaped vista and pure water would be recycled from sewage. The air would be cleaner than that in any city on earth because of constant filtering.[Dr. Gerard] O'Neill said construction could begin now, using present technology, and the first colony could be functional by the early 1990s.See also:Delicious Waste Liquids of the Future (1982)Robot Rebellion (1982)Space Colony Pirates (1981)Sport in Space Colonies (1977)Space Colonies by Don DavisMore Space Colony Art (1970s)Mars and Beyond (1957)Challenge of Outer Space (circa 1950s)",

Seriously though, the writer openly mocks these kids for their predictions. Stupid kids and their stupid visions of the future.(Remember that the harsh commentary in parentheses is the author's, and not mine. Stupid kids.)Kids' Letters Picture Life in Year 2075By Patricia McCromack (UPI Education Editor)The fifth grader pursed his lips and read once more a letter he'd just written to his great-great-grandchildren - whom he'll have little chance of seeing unless he lives to be 110.The 10-year-old, writing to his descendants who will be going to school in 2075, reached in his pocket and pulled out a picture. He pasted it on the letter, picked up his pen and added:\"I know this is funny, but here is a picture of your great-great-grand dog. His name is Casey.\"The letter-writing assignment at St. Vito's School, Mamaroneck, N.Y., was a creative writing project. Fourth and fifth graders, ages 9 to 11, participated.An analysis of the letters shows what's on the pint-sized set's mind these days:\"I think in 100 years the world will be beautiful. The prices will be lower.\" (This child's got inflation on the mind and he's an optimist).\"You probably have a train that goes 2,000 miles an hour and gets from Mrs (sic) to Jupiter in hours. Boy, do I wish I was there.\" (This student better study his stars again. Or - maybe he knows something we don't know).\"You probably have automatic sidewalks everywhere. All you do is stand and the sidewalk moves. We have to walk back here in 1975 and boy is it boring.\" (This ungrateful child forgot to mention times mother drives her).\"You know, you are pretty lucky. You may have automatic tennis rackets that never miss the ball. We have to aim at the ball and then swing the racket. It's a pain when you miss the ball.\" (Penned, undoubtedly, by a student who just had a bad tennis lesson).Many letters expressed concern for the happiness and well-being of those to follow. Consider these greetings:\"Have a good life. Take care of your mother and father and your sisters and brothers and grandmother.\"\"I am nine years old and I love you. And when I am dead, I want you to be good and love your mother.\"These letters, written on cotton fiber paper so they'll last 100 years, aren't being put in a time capsule to be opened with great ceremony in the community in the year 2075.They have been placed in the custody of the parents - for safekeeping and passing along.They'll probably make it to their destination.

        "title": "Technology and Man's Future (1972)",
        "text": "The introduction to the book Technology and Man's Future has a tone appropriate for 1972. The words seem to offer a first glimpse into true disillusionment with early 20th century futurism. And yet, the book nurtures remnants of optimism; of hope that the future may hold some version, however imperfect, of that shiny, happy future.Below is an excerpt from the introduction to the book.I grew up believing in a technological future. The picture of tomorrow's world that I carried around in my head throughout childhood years corresponded, more or less, to that which one might have acquired from any number of science-fiction movies or from such monuments to technology as the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago. It was characterized mainly by neatness and order, miles of gleaming chrome, millions of buttons to push, and endless gadgets to do all the work. All of our \"old-fashioned\" ways of doing things were, I believed, to be replaced by new, modern, better ones. Automated highways would take the place of conventional roads; one nourishment pill in the morning would save us consuming three meals during the day. In retrospect, what I find to be particularly interesting in this childhood image is the fact that the technological future always seemed to be an end in itself. When adults in my life spoke of it, they implied its inevitability - with some interest and some, but not much, enthusiasm. No one seemed to care very much for the prospect, but it was \"progress,\" and only a fool would try to resist its tide. Similar notions were apparently the main themes of the Century of Progress International Exposition held in Chicago in 1933. In the great world's fair tradition, this extravagant celebration aimed to demonstrate what technology was capable of doing for humanity. In the process, it brought out dramatically what one author has called \"technology's triumph over man.\" Upon entering the Hall of Science, one was confronted by a large sculptural group featuring a life-sized man and woman, their \"hands outstretched as if in fear or ignorance.\" Between this couple stood a giant angular robot almost twice their size, bending down, with a metallic arm \"thrown reassuringly around each.\" The visitor to the fair need not  have searched far for the meaning of this image. It could be found in the Exposition motto: SCIENCE FINDS - INDUSTRY APPLIES - MAN CONFORMS.As I grew older, I naturally began to question my childhood vision, putting aside a fascination with gadgets to ask myself what was lacking in this future. Why, despite all good intentions, did this image of the future always come out looking more like Brave New World or 1984 than Utopia? What was the meaning of \"progress\" in these terms, if no one ever asked whether it serves to make people happier?See also:Future Shock (1972)Headlines of the Near Future (1972)Progress to Counter Catastrophe Theory?

        "text": "Bob MacKenzie wrote a relatively balanced and thoughtful piece about the future of television in the February 3, 1974 Oakland Tribune titled, \"A 'Tomorrow' Look At World Of TV.\" Even articles about television were shaped by the energy fears of the 1970s.\"It now seems possible that we won't keep getting richer,\" MacKenzie writes. \"The energy to run those room-size television screens and 3-D telecasts may have to be used for something more mundane.... like heating the joint or getting the old man to work and back.\"Later in the article, MacKenzie explains what made movie theaters unique in an era before HBO and VHS tapes, \"At present the movie theaters are offering patrons what they can't get on their home screens - bloody violence, nudity, sex, naughty words. But even those never-failing attractions will be available on television in the future....\"The piece in its entirety appears below.Malcolm Muggeridge, the ancient, acidic book critic writing in Esquire, likes to refer to \"future historians . . . if there are any.\" We must now consider the case of future television watchers, if there are any.What will they watch, and on what?Every era rewrites the future; visionaries of the 1960s told us about all the fantastic electronic gear that would doubtless bring the world into the living rooms of future Americans - not only in sounds and pictures, but in odors too; specials about pollution would come complete with stink. The images would likely be three-dimensional and life size. Some of the more fervent prognosticators even looked forward to feelevision.Video screens, it was said with what seemed optimism at the time, would cover entire walls in our homes. Channels would be unlimited; the viewer would be able to tune in on a Russian news program or a course in Latvian cooking at the touch of a button, or rather, a wave of the hand over a sensory node.Banking and shopping would be done at home through two-way television communications. Voting would be done directly through the video system. Local town meetings would be conducted through television, with the participants all sitting home.Three-dimensional television, technically feasible through ionization of alpha particles in the air that fills the living room, would bring life-size actors walking around in the room. Viewers would be able to enter into the drama, play roles, with computerized dialogue responding to the home player's improvised lines.It all sounded wonderful. Or did it?All those dreams of endless fun and self-improvement through the magic of super-television depended in part of the reigning ideology of the time which was: everything is always going to keep getting bigger and better.Suddenly the doctrine of eternal abundance as a basic American right is seen as not so certain any more. We are running out of things. And the inevitability of progress can't be taken quite so readily for granted.It now seems possible that we won't keep getting richer. The energy to run those room-size television screens and 3-D telecasts may have to be used for something more mundane.... like heating the joint or getting the old man to work and back.The supersize television screens postulated a complete changeover in television technology; in other words, the scrapping of every piece of television equipment now in use - every home set, every camera and videotape machine. For, to increase the size of the screen considerably, we would have to increase the numbers of lines of transmission. That means new machines.This could happen in 100 years. Almost anything could. But it probably won't happen for a long while, so finish paying off that color set.Does the energy crunch and all its attendant melancholy side-effects mean that television technology isn't going anywhere?Not at all. In the near future we'll be receiving new messages new waves on new equipment - not in life-size tri-dimensional smellovision, but in conventional television with improvements.Like miniaturization, for instance. This branch of the electronic sciences has boomed in the past few decades. The tiny transistors which replaced the cumbersome vacuum tubes have themselves been replaced by even tinier, miraculously encoded bits of metal called MOS chips. One chip the size of a nailhead replaces hundreds of transistors. Not only are they littler, they're cheaper.What does this mean for you and me? How about a perfectly flat television set that can be hung on the wall like a picture? Perfectly feasible in the near future. And the wrist television set, a la Dick Tracy, is now a practicable machine. Within a decade or so, you may be carrying a tiny walkie-talkie-like device in your shirt pocket. We may all be in instant audial and visual touch with one another.Once the technology of miniature television receivers is worked out, they will be inexpensive to construct. And they will use less energy than present set, the pocket TV set will be as handy as a pocket calculator - and probably less expensive, since everyone will have one.Every technological advance has its darker side, of course. If everyone is immediately reachable by two-way television, your boss will always be able to find you - not to mention your wife and your friendly local loan company.Cassette TV is really on the way, too. A home library of cassettes will be a normal middle-class acquisition long before the Tribune Tower weathers its second centennial. But don't expect home cassettes to arrive immediately, or to be inexpensive when they do arrive. It will be a long time before cassettes reach the mass-distribution economics of the music recording industry. even when it does, a taped television program will cost at least twice what you will pay for an LP music tape.Since, as mentioned before, it's just possible we won't all be richer then, how will the average family buy TV cassettes of the movies, instruction courses, plays, etc, that will be offered?Probably by renting cassettes, or borrowing them from public libraries. Cassette TV, when it arrives, will bring the convenience of books and magazines: the viewer will watch a program of his choice, at a time of his choosing.Full-scale home cassette television should arrive within 10 years, provided we do not develop air shortage in the meantime, and provided the Japanese continue to improve in what used to be called American knowhow.What about television programs? How will they change?100 years in the future is very far ahead to peer; if there are still television programs then, they will be about things of interest to a people who will be as unlike us as we are unlike the steerage passengers in the Mayflower. Perhaps their programs will be instructional \"How to Eat Plastic,\" or \"I Breathed in Los Angeles and Lived.\"Who knows? We will leave these matters to future television columnists, if any. But we can look into the immediate future and make some educated guesses about programs in 10 and 20 years, based on the ways programs are changing now.The most immediately obvious evolution in television is toward bigger and better movies for television. In a very few years, features produced for TV have moved from skimpily budgeted trash (Z-pictures, one critic called them) to a healthy form that often supplies good entertainment and occasionally brings memorable drama.TV-movies still supply plenty of trash (perhaps trash is a needed commodity; the world has never been without it), and budgets are still small. But changes are coming, and very soon.Small budgets and high aspirations have managed fine television movies like \"Brian's Song\"; but in the future producers may not be so confined in the money department. Ways are being found to produce full-scale motion pictures for television.\"The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman\" might be considered the first of anew generation of television movies. Produced with scope and size, this fine picture was budgeted at $900,000 - still a low expense for a theatrical movie, but double or triple the cost of most TV-movies. A network contract for four showings, plus planned revenue for European theatrical bookings, will pay for the film and bring a profit.Another venture, on NBC, is called International World Premiere. By this plan, new movies for television will be seen on NBC the same night they open in theaters in other countries - so the producers, with revenues from both TV and theaters, can hire major stars and deliver full-scale production.Eventually, as other ways of financing television films are found, movies for television will become the equal of theatrical movies - in quality if not in sensationalism.At present the movie theaters are offering patrons what they can't get on their home screens - bloody violence, nudity, sex, naughty words.But even those never-failing attractions will be available on television in the future - if not in the regularly scheduled programs, then in cassette television. And, needless to say, Cassettes will bring the era of readily-available TV pornography. Whether that constitutes an advance for the civilized world the reader must decide for himself.And as long as people persist in being human, television drama will concern the same subjects that drama has always treated: the timeless issues of love and faith and valor and ambition and loss, the yearnings of the heart and itchings of the glands.People will always be interested in these things. And television, or whatever replaces it in the incalculable, unpredictable future, will still be staging the stories about the good guys versus the bad guys.With any luck, the good guys will still be winning.See also:Home Entertainment of the Future (1981)Living Room of the Future (1979)Movie Trends of the 21st Century (1982)How Experts Think We'll Live in 2000 A.D.

An excerpt appears below but you can read the entire article here.What brings on future shock, according to Toffler, is a rate of social change that has become so fast as to be impossible for most human beings to assimilate. \"The malaise, mass neurosis, irrationality and free-floating violence already apparent in contemporary life are merely a foretaste of what may lie ahead unless we come to understand and treat this disease,\" Toffler argues. \"Future shock arises from the superimposition of a new culture on an old one. It is culture shock in one's own society. But its impact is far worse. For most travelers have the comforting knowledge that the culture they left behind will be there to return to.

An excerpt appears below.Even so, it's not fair to say that all futurism is misguided. Just most of it. In his 1976 Time essay \"Is There Any Future in Futurism?\" Stefan Kanfer wrote that you could divide futurists into neo-Malthusians and Cornucopians. Neo-Malthusians are convinced that the world is going to hell. Some, like The Population Bomb's Paul Ehrlich, blamed population growth; others, like the Club of Rome, blamed economic growth.

Ehrlich, so concerned about what he saw as a population explosion, wanted forced birth control, child lotteries and the \"spiking of foreign food aid with antifertility drugs.\"I recently found a 1970 edition of his book and now offer you excerpts from his bizarrely specific \"Scenario 1\" (of which there were three) featured in the second chapter. Ehrlich stipulated that, \"...none of [the scenarios] will come true as stated, but they describe the kinds of disasters that will occur as mankind slips into the famine decades.\"\"In 1972 news of the war in Thailand occupies the headlines of the United States, China has catastrophic floods, a breakdown of communications, and massive famines. Increasingly serious food riots in China, India, and Brazil are a matter of great concern to the Central Intelligence Agency.\"\"In early January, 1973, large numbers of Chinese troops move into the Thai conflict for the first time. They receive tactical air support from bases in North Vietnam.\"\"After an unheeded warning, tactical nuclear weapons are used in strikes on selected Chinese air bases, supply complexes, and staging areas in North Vietnam, Thailand, and southern China. With the connivance of the Russians a preemptive strike is also launched against China's nuclear facilities. Unfortunately, our defenses are not sufficient to prevent five 'dirty' Chinese thermo-nuclear devices, transported in submarines, from being detonated in the sea off our West Coast. Fallout results in more than 100 million American deaths.\"If you thought Scenario 1 was incredible stay tuned for Scenarios 2 and 3.",

Again, this is excerpted from the 1970 edition of the book.\"In 1979 the last non-Communist government in Latin America, that of Mexico, is replaced by a Chinese-supported military junta.\"\"Only the outbreak of a particularly virulent strain of bubonic plague killing 65% of the starving Egyptian population had averted a direct Soviet-American clash in the Mediterranean.\"\"The third Los Angeles killer smog in two years has wiped out 90,000 people....The President's Environmental Advisory Board has reported a measurable rise in the sea level due to melting polar ice caps. [The Board] recommends the immediate compulsory restriction of births to one per couple, and compulsory sterilization of all persons with I.Q. scores under 90.\"\"Pollution and pesticide poisonings have supplanted cardio-vascular disease as the number one killer of Americans.\"\"[In early 1980] general thermonuclear war ensues. Particularly devastating are the high altitude 'flash' devices designed to set fire to all flammable materials over huge areas. At one point 15 monster fires rage in the Northern Hemisphere. Each covers an average area of 400,000 square miles - four times the area of Colorado.\"\"[Radiation levels] make two-thirds of the Earth uninhabitable. Pollution of the sea is vastly increased.

        "text": "It is a fitting day to look at Paul Ehrlich's third and final scenario of agri-apocalypse from his 1968 book, The Population Bomb.Today Norman Borlaug, probably the greatest living American, received the Congressional Gold Medal. Mr. Bourlag received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1970 after becoming an integral figure in the \"Green Revolution.\"While Paul Ehrlich was advocating forced birth control and spiking foreign food aid with antifertility drugs, Norman Borlaug was figuring out how to literally save a billion people using technology.Below are excerpts from Ehrlich's third nightmare scenario. Ehrlich thought it would get so bad so quickly that the Pope would give his blessing to abortion by 1974.In 1974 the United States government finally realizes that the food-population balance in much of Asia, Africa, and South America is such that most areas cannot attain self-sufficiency. American expeditionary forces are withdrawn from Vietnam and Thailand, and the United States announces it will no longer send food to India, Egypt, and some other countries which it considers beyond hope. A moderate food rationing program is instituted in the United States. It further announces that food production in the United States will be increased only so long as the increase can be accomplished without damage to the environment of the North American continent. Pope Pius XIII, yielding to pressure from enlightened Catholics, announces that all good Catholics have a responsibility to drastically restrict their productive activities. He gives his blessing to abortion and all methods of contraception. Several cheap, long-term anticonception drugs are developed and made available for wide distribution.Famine and plague sweep the Arab world, which, in the face of Russia's growing disinterest, is forced to seek peace and cooperation with Israel. Israel, in grave economic trouble, installs a peace government and begins negotiations. Most of the countries of Africa and South America slide backward into famine and local warfare. Many adopt Communistic governments, but few are able to achieve any stability.Ehrlich ends the chapter by callously calling the third scenario an appealing one even though it \"presumes the death by starvation of perhaps as many as half a billion people, one-fifth of the world's population.\" Enhrlich then challenges the reader to devise a scenario more optimistic than the last and writes that he \"won't accept one that starts, 'In early 1972 the first monster space ships from a planet of the star Alpha Centauri arrive bearing CARE packages . . .'\"How about a scenario that starts with, \"In 1942 a young man named Norman Borlaug received his Ph.D. in plant pathology and genetics and decided to help save a billion human lives.\"See also:The Population Bomb: Scenario 1 (1970)The Population Bomb: Scenario 2 (1970)",

The Dale was to be produced in the mid-1970s by the not-quite-futuristically-named Twentieth Century Motor Car Corporation, and bore some resemblance to the General Motors three-wheeled concept car (in reverse) from 1964. Funny thing about the supposed 70 mile-per-gallon Dale? It was a fraud. There was no Dale car, and no intention to manufacture it. Twentieth Century Motor Car Corp was started by entrepreneur-poseur Liz Carmichael who, according to this People magazine article from 1975, was born Jerry Dean Michael. I love that Liz added the word \"car\" to her given last name.Carmichael made off with thousands of dollars gleaned from excited inventors, until being arrested and charged with grand theft, fraud and securities violations. She jumped bail but was again caught after the airing of this episode.

        "text": "It's no secret that I love food. The first issue of Paleofuture Magazine and the first episode of paleofuture.tv are certainly a testament to that. And some might even consider me an adventurous eater. I recently tried cow brain for the first time and will occassionally indulge (much to the disgust of coworkers) in a tongue-stuffed burrito. But for some reason I just can't bring myself to eat bugs. I don't know if it's the texture or the fact that I'm already so full on spiders* after a good night's rest, but a grasshopper salad has never appealed to me.The 1978 book Future Food: Alternate Protein for the Year 2000 by Barbara Ford includes a menu chock full of creepy crawly delicacies and scientifical concoctions. On Ms. Ford's menu you'll find not only crickets and mealworms, but also pueblo chenopod salad, science soy bread, roast chevon a la heidi, opaque 2 corn, lake chad algae, and tofu fruit whip.Predictions about a move away from animal products or simply finding \"alternative proteins\" aren't new. This 1914 article from a Montana newspaper predicted that by the end of the 20th century animal food would be abandoned entirely. Ford's book doesn't predict the end of humans eating meat, but she's a big advocate of finding alternatives to what's currently considered acceptable for our plates. The book presents a fascinating collision of post-WWII food science utopianism and 1970's health food earthiness that I haven't often come across.And yes, you read that right, chapter four is indeed titled \"The Magical Fruit.\"In this fascinating and important book, Barbara Ford tells us that by the year 2000 Americans will obtain a large portion of their protein from alternate proteins: food sources such as beans, high-protein grains, non-dairy cheese and milk, unusual forms of marine life, leafy plants such as alfalfa that are now fed exclusively to livestock, one- celled plants such as algae, strange plants you never heard of but undoubtedly will, and an assortment of \"weird\" proteins that includes insects, reptiles, rodents, small game such as possum, raccoons, and even dogs. Our sense of obligation to other people as well as our hardheaded interest in a stable world society almost demand that we cease feeding 98 percent of our soybean crop to animals, as we do today. The use of alternatives to animal protein frees vegetable protein for human use. The chief reason, however, for the predicted change in the American diet is economic. Traditional sources of protein cost more than they used to; from all indications they will continue to rise in price. Future Food is an invaluable and assiduously researched study. In it, Barbara Ford appraises the most important work being carried out 61 scientists to develop new kinds of protein, and she assesses their value. She advises on where to find these new food sources and how to incorporate them into our diet in the most nutritious form. She shows us that by the year 2000 we will be eating Squid Stew and Buffalo Gourd Meal and loving it. *Yes, I realize spiders are arachnids. Shut up, nerds.",

        "text": "The article \"Age Wars: The Coming Battle Between Young and Old\" is from the January/February, 1986 issue of The Futurist magazine. Though the content isn't necessarily funny, the piece makes me laugh every time I look at it, thanks to the amazing picture that complements the headline so well.1986 Jan-Feb Futurist \"Age Wars\"  1986 Jan-Feb Futurist \"Age Wars\" paleofuture Article about the \"coming battle between young and old.\"  The piece is actually very thoughtful and raises a lot of interesting questions about the paleo-future which are relevant today. An excerpt appears below but you can read the entire piece above.Americans have always been an exceptionally optimistic people - and never more so than now. In the late 1970s, it was fashionable to question whether the country had at last entered an \"era of limits,\" but the rallying cry these days is \"America is back!\" Inflation is down, employment is up, the military is strong, and energy is plentiful. This is not the season to peddle unhappy thoughts about the future of America, much less to call for sacrifice.Yet today's prosperity is being purchased at the eventual expense of today's younger citizens and those yet unborn. As a result, the early decades of the next century may well bring a war between the generations, as tomorrow's elderly attempt to compel the young to honor the compounding debts of the present era.The United States is now using an almost endless variety of means to distribute wealth and opportunity away from future taxpayers. After more than two decades of declining expenditures for public works, the cost of repairing the nation's dilapidated bridges, roads, waterways, and other infrastructure is conservatively estimated at more than $1 trillion.Previously on Paleo-Future:Age 75 to be Noon of Life in Year 2000 (Chicago Daily Tribune, 1925)Health Care in 1994 (1973)Progress to Counter Catastrophe?

        "title": "Android Love of the Future (1982)",
        "text": "The June 2, 1982 Washington Post ran a short piece about lovebots of the future. The article by Stephanie Mansfield predicts androids would be on the market by the mid-1990s, and likely revolutionize the way people looked at sexual relations.  Arthur Harkins, director of the graduate program in futures research at the University of Minnesota, is even quoted as saying that android-human relationships might be treated as common-law marriages. I suppose as long as people didn't get gay-robo-married the U.S. would be okay with that. I can hear the asinine protest chants already, \"it's WALL-E and EVE, not Elektro and Steve!\" The entire piece appears below.He comes home every night, grabs a beer and falls asleep in front of the television. You might as well be married to a robot, you say. Well, by the year 2000, you could be.He may even look like Cary Grant, talk about white-water rafting, be able to fix a drink and possibly even be good in bed,\" says Arthur Harkins, director of the graduate program in futures research at the University of Minnesota.\"One of the things we're seeing now is that people are shopping for other people the way they'd shop for an appliance,\" he says, citing the proliferation of computerized dating services, explicitly worded personal want ads and marriage brokers. \"You're buying something that makes you happy.\"Domestic robot systems are expected to come on the market by the mid-1990s, according to Harkins, and sell for several thousand dollars. These highly sophisticated androids can be programmed to offer a wide range of human personality traits. (\"We can even make them neurotic\") and are likely to be purchased by \"people who have difficulty opening up to other human being,\" he says.These surrogate spouses would be beneficial to very lonely people.But can you fall in love with a robot? \"Why not?\" says Harkins, citing a bedridden hospital patient. \"Along comes this wonderful android who doesn't care a bit about that, whereas other human beings may not be so inclined.\"The union between man and machine would not be recognized as legal, Harkins says, but perhaps could be treated as a common-law marriage. And there's no question of a messy divorce. \"Just trade it in, I suppose,\" the scientist says.Another example of future schlock was the robot pets offered by Neiman-Marcus last Christmas, which Harkins says only strengthens his theory that people today want certainty. \"They want somebody predictable,\" he says.But Harkins says he doesn't want to trade in his own wife for a robot -- just yet. Not even, he fantasizes, \"a Margot Kidder robot.\"\"I'd be bored stiff,\" he says. \"But I may get to be 70 years old and look at a Mae West robot with a great deal of interest.\" Previously on Paleo-Future:Robots for Romantic Old Maids (1928)Elektro and Sparko Ad (1956)Sex in the Year 2019 (1986)Impacts of Robotic Sex (1997) ",

An excerpt appears below.Billy Graham, since the beginning of his evangelistic ministry, has been telling his followers that the Second Coming is near, although he no longer pinpoints the date as he did in 1950. \"We may have another year, maybe two years, to work for Jesus Christ,\" he said that year. \"And then, ladies and gentlemen, I believe it's going to be all over.\"That was 30 years ago.Today Graham will only say that \"Our Lord gave a summary of events that signal his return and the end of the world as we know it. He named conditions that would prevail. Reading them one must be struck by their resemblance to what we see daily on our TV screens and in our newspapers.\"Some of the Bible \"signs\" Graham sees taking place are \"wars and rumors of wars, famine, earthquakes, multiplied lawlessness and iniquity, and the return of the Jews to their homeland.\"The photograph of Billy Graham was taken April 11, 1966 by Warren K. Leffler and can be found at the Library of Congress website.

However, I did find a little gem of a song that was featured in the Communicore exhibit for just a few short years.  The song is called The Computer Song and was composed by the Sherman Brothers, best known for their work on the Mary Poppins and Parent Trap films as well as classic Disney rides like the Enchanted Tiki Room, Carousel of Progress and Journey Into Imagination. The song played at the Astuter Computer Revue attraction.The song praises the computer for \"making life easier\" as well as \"saving time and headaches.\"  When was the last time you thought of your personal computer that way?  The computer noises are priceless. Ah, the beautiful paleo-future. Don't forget to click on \"Astuter Computer Revue\" to listen to the song in its entirety.",

Their 1981 exhibition of screenprints, derived from Buckminster Fuller drawings, must have been stunning. The catalogue reproduces thirteen screenprints which were produced under the supervision of Fuller. The edition was limited to 60 numbered portfolios which are selling today for $45,000!A photo of Fuller signing the screenprints appears above. Below you will find the introduction to the catalogue. Look for more from this rare book soon. Many thanks to Brian Horrigan, co-author of Yesterday's Tomorrows, for lending it to me. (I only recently discovered that Mr. Horrigan and I live just blocks from each other, and he was kind enough to lend me some great rare material.)This catalogue reproduces a portfolio of thirteen screenprints and text by Buckminster Fuller published under the supervision of Buckminster Fuller by Colophon, Cincinnati, Ohio. The edition is limited to 60 numbered portfolios (1-60) and 20 hors commerce (I-XX). Each of the thirteen prints consists of two 30\" by 40\" screenprinted sheets, one of which illustrates drawings for a patent invention by Fuller, and the second sheet illustrates the realization of the concept. These two sheets may be presented separately, in two frames; or together, as an overlay, in one frame. This catalogue reproduces both presentation options.The patent invention drawings are screenprinted in white ink on a clear polyester film. A plain blue backing sheet, provided with each print, may be placed under the clear film patent drawings to create the effect of a blueprint. The accompanying photo realization  of each invention is a screenprint on Lenox 100 percent rag paper. The text pages and the blue backing sheets are Curtis Tweedweave 100 percent rag paper made especially for this portfolio.Each of the thirteen prints in the portfolio is hand signed and numbered by Buckminster Fuller on the clear film element.See also:Fuller's Traveling Cartridge (circa 1960s)The Most Well-Documented Lives in HistorySea City 2000 (1979) ",

        "text": "The 1981 book School, Work and Play (World of Tomorrow) features this beautiful two-page spread. Apparently, thanks to computers, there's no crime in the future outside of the computerized variety. The \"computer criminal\" pictured really doesn't appear to be running very fast. Maybe they're playing a game of freeze-tag. Or maybe that policeman's gun has special settings the author didn't tell us about. I like to believe the former, but that's just me.Computers will make the world of tomorrow a much safe place. They will do away with cash, so that you need no longer fear being attacked for your money. In addition, you need not worry that your home will be burgled or your car stolen. The computers in your home and car will guard them, allowing only yourself to enter or someone with your permission.However, there is one kind of crime which may exist in the future - computer crime. Instead of mugging people in the streets or robbing houses, tomorrow's criminal may try to steal money from banks and other organizations using a computer. The computer criminal works from home, using his own computer to gain access to the memories of the computers used by the banks and companies. The criminal tries to interfere with the computers in order to get them to transfer money to his computer without the bank or company knowing that it has been robbed.Computer crime like this in fact exists already. However, it is very difficult to carry out a successful robbery by computer. Many computers have secret codes to prevent anyone but their owners from operating them. As computers are used more and more, it is likely that computer crime will become increasingly difficult to carry out.Nevertheless, a computer criminal may succeed now and then and the detectives of the future will have to be highly skilled computer operators. There will probably be police computer-fraud squads, specially trained to deal with computer crime. Here you can see a squad arriving at the home of a computer criminal and arresting him as he makes a dash for it. He is clutching a computer cassette that contains details of his computer crimes, and the police will need this as evidence to prove that he is guilty.Previously on Paleo-Future:Robot Rebellion (1982)Wristwatch of the Future as Crimefighter (1979)The Road Ahead: Future of Police Work (1995)Border Surveillance of 1990 (1977) ",

It's not a school day, so you can do whatever you like. However, it's raining, so you can't play outside. Although scientists can now control the weather, this is done only in certain places to produce artificial climates that aid farming. Your home is not one of these places. Even though everyone is busy and you're stuck at home on your own, you're still going to have an exciting and interesting day. After breakfast, you rush on to the living room. It has chairs and other furniture in new designs as well as some antiques like a twentieth-century digital clock and a push-button telephone. However, the room is dominated by a large viewscreen linked to the home computer.You ask the computer to contact several friends, and they begin to appear on the screen. Soon you're linked into a worldwide group of people, all of whom can talk to and see each other. After chatting for a while, you decide to play some games together. As you can't agree on what to play, the computer makes up your minds for you. It gives you puzzles to do and devises quizzes, as well as all kinds of electronic games. The computer keeps the scores as you play against one another, and then it gives you games in which you all play the computer. You carry on until someone loses interest and tries to cheat for fun. The computer finds out and everyone laughs. Then it's time to break up the party and have lunch.After lunch you decide to spend some time on your own at a hobby or craft you particularly enjoy. Making things of all kinds is easy with the computer. You design them on the screen of the terminal in your playroom, and then the computer operates a machine that constructs the objects in materials such as plastics. This system is very good for making your own clothes. You can dress up in all kinds of fantastic garments that you design yourself. To avoid waste, the objects and clothes can be fed back into the machine and the materials recycled or used again.See also:Future Arcade Games (1985)Connections: AT&amp;T's Vision of the Future (Part 3, 1993)Virtual Reality (1980s-today)Homework in the Future (1981)Home Entertainment of the Future (1981)Learning in 1999 A.D.

        "text": "The Omni Future Almanac is 293 pages of paleo-future glory. In the \"Projected Computer Milestones\" section of the book I naturally turned to 2007, curious just how far behind we are. It then occurred to me that if we interpret the DMCA in a certain way, we are sadly right on schedule.Demand for a global Computer Rights Pact will lead to the signing of such an agreement by most world nations. This document will set forth rights of humans and computers over authorship of software (including books, movies, economic models, etc.), creation of patentable systems, and mistakes arising from computer recommendations. At the same time, a Computer Appeals Network may be established for countries to air international grievances. Even in the 1980s, questions arising from the theft of computer software and hardware have frequently arisen. American software companies have been particularly vulnerable to theft of material by Soviet agents.",

        "title": "Computers: Get Used to Them! (1982)",
        "text": "I would argue that the most funny, edgy and entertaining writing in the U.S. does not come from The Onion, but from high school newspapers. Granted, the humor coming from the Hormonal Fourth Estate may be largely unintentional, but it can be hilarious nonetheless.As editor of the \"Reviews\" section of my high school newspaper I was notoriously bad at my job. I rarely attended class and edited my stories with the same attention to detail Don Draper gives his wife. My lack of diligence even got the \"f-bomb\" inadvertently published in my high school paper.It is with this same high standard that I present a piece by Kevin Jensen. His story appeared in the November 26, 1982 edition of his high school newspaper, the Oelwein Husky Register.Titled, \"Computers, Get Used to Them!\" the article says that computers are on their way but we have nothing to fear (as long as we have sledgehammers). The opening line starts by insulting the reader and just keeps getting better. The entire piece appears below.Unless you're totally ignorant, you have probably noticed that computers are the talk of the early 1980's. If you're a typical American, you are probably also growing tired of hearing how these computers will be running your life in the near future.You may even have a slight fear of computers. No, I don't mean you wake up in the middle of the night in a cold sweat screaming, \"Don't hurt me, computers!\" But I think we all have a slight fear or uneasy feeling over things we are unfamiliar with.Contrary to what you may have heard, your hands will not fall of when you touch the keyboard of a computer.I was a little apprehensive when I walked into a computer programming class for the first time this year. All I knew about computers, prior to class, was they had computed my class schedule the last two years.As I began to become more familiar with computer language and how to write computer programs, my uneasiness went away and I found working with computers enjoyable.If you are considering taking a computer class (whether you are an adult or a student), I think you'd enjoy it. You may struggle a little at first learning the language and proper usage of statements, but with some persistence on your part, your mind will start picking up the techniques naturally.You will probably also discover in your early stages of computer study that the computer can be a friend at times or a foe at other times, because of your inexperience.For example, in computer programming class, when a program you have sweated over and worked on ruthlessly for a considerable length of time is run on the computer screen just as you planned, you might give the computer a nice pat on the top and then proceed to print out \"your pride and joy.\"On the other hand, when a different program assignment does not run on the computer screen as planned and the screen is showing you what seems like an infinite number of incorrect statements in your program you wish like heck you had a \"nice\" sledgehammer to make the computer see things your way.Whether you like or dislike computers or are or aren't interested in them, you had better get used to hearing about them in the media. The experts predict that computers are going to be with us a long time and will be as commonplace in the home as the telephone by the year 2000.Read More:Computer Games of the Future (1981)Computers in the Home by Year 2000 (1978)Living Room of the Future (1979)Computersville is almost here (1970) ",

        "title": "David Byrne's 1987 Predictions for the Computers of 2007",
        "text": "The January, 1987 issue of OMNI Magazine included a cover story titled, \"14 Great Minds Predict the Future.\" OMNI asked influential people from a variety of fields what was in store for humanity in the year 2007, twenty years into the future. There were predictions about everything from peace in the Middle East to 3D televisions.David Byrne, lead singer and songwriter of the Talking Heads, gazed into his crystal ball to write about pop art, the future of television, and why computers will never help the creative process. With the benefit of hindsight it's a little hard to believe that Byrne was so pessimistic about the potential for computers as a creative tool, especially when futuristic designs for computers were getting so many others excited. An excerpt from the OMNI piece appears below. David Byrne, Lead Singer, Talking HeadsI don't think computers will have any important effect on the arts in 2007. When it comes to the arts they're just big or small adding machines. And if they can't \"think,\" that's all they'll ever be. They may help creative people with their bookkeeping, but they won't help in the creative process.The video revolution, however, will have some real impact on the arts in the next 20 years. It already has. Because people's attention spans are getting shorter, more fiction and drama will be done by television, a perfect medium for them. But I don't think anything will be wiped out; books will always be there; everything will find its place.Outlets for art, in the marketplace and on television, will multiply and spread. Even the three big TV networks will feature looser, more specialized programming to appeal to special-interest groups. The networks will be freed from the need to try to please everybody, which they do now and inevitably end up with a show so stupid nobody likes it. Obviously this multiplication of outlets will benefit the arts.I don't think we'll see the participatory art that so many people predict. Some people will use new equipment to make art, but they will be the same people who would have been making art anyway. Still, I definitely think that the general public will be interested in art that was once considered avant-garde.",

I dare say that this is the most accurate prediction we've looked at in 2009 (provided we ignore that robot arm, offering up delicious Christmas treats before it slaughters the entire family in a bloody rampage). Enjoy!The caption:Christmas in the future is an exciting occasion. Here the children have been given a home music and video system that links into the home computer. They are eagerly trying it out. The eldest boy is using the video camera to record pictures of the family, which are showing on the computer viewscreen. However, someone else is playing with the computer controls and changing the images for fun. At the same time, another child is working at the music synthesizer, creating some music to go with the crazy pictures.Main text:Have you ever wanted to conduct a huge orchestra, or direct a film? Very few people now get to do these thrilling jobs. However, the techniques of microelectronics are beginning to invade music and the visual arts, making possible all kinds of new and mazing ways of creating music and images. As computers develop, these techniques will begin to enter the home. You'll have the glorious sounds of vast orchestras and the excitement of the movies at your fingertips.Your orchestra will not be a real one, but an electronic one with sounds created by a synthesizer. On command, the synthesizer's computer will play the music with any sounds you want. Singing is easy too. You can speak the words into the computer, and out will come choirs using your words or maybe even the voice of a famous singer of your choice.You can make a film electronically too, by using video cameras and recorders. You can record family events, holidays, the world of nature, and even make your own video films with actors.However, the home computer video system of the future will enable you to make these shows into spectacular entertainments. The computer will be able to take the images you record and assemble and treat them in all kinds of ways to produce a whole range of special effects of your very own. And you will also be able to use the computer to produce unusual moving designs and patterns, rather like making video cartoons or electronic paintings that move. Then you can put your video shows together with your own electronic music, and create the most stunning experiences -- perhaps even a totally new art form of the future!

        "text": "While perusing the shelves of a great Portland bookstore (Portland, OR really has the best used book stores in the country) I stumbled across the book Doomsday 1999 A.D. by Charles Berlitz and immediately flipped to the last chapter.In the \"apocalypse porn\" genre you'll find that the final chapter is where the author either hedges his bets (maybe we won't all die, after all...) or offers an absurd possibility for the survival of mankind (let's spike foreign food aid with anti-fertility drugs!). Berlitz chooses to do a bit of both with a chapter called \"The Arks of the Future.\"Below is an excerpt from the final chapter of the book.Although the idea of piloted UFOs and intelligent life in space is usually considered with a certain amount of sardonic humor, it nevertheless remains a possibility and should be considered as an added opportunity for Earth's peoples, through knowledge of its drive and methods, to develop another means of escape from our environment if or when it becomes untenable.Our legends from an earlier world tell us of a great ship or ships which provided a refuge in far places of the earth, but perhaps after the next catastrophe Earth itself may become inimicable to humanity. Our survival plans should therefore be predicated on an intensified exploration of space; not only to find a refuge but also to expand our observation of the universe, to be able thereby to avoid or control dangers within the cosmos which may even now be drawing closer to Earth.

        "title": "Ebert's Art Film Revolution (1987)",
        "text": "OMNI magazine interviewed Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert about the future of movies for their June, 1987 issue. Ebert makes some bold and accurate predictions about how a revolution in the delivery and distribution of movies will open up the \"art film\" market, allowing people greater access to movies that may not make financial sense to screen in the theaters of smaller cities. An excerpt from the interview appears below.OMNI: How will the fierce competition between television and the movies work out in the future?EBERT: We will have high-definition, wide-screen television sets and a push-button dialing system to order the movie you want at the time you want it. You'll not go to a video store but instead order a movie on demand and then pay for it. Videocassette tapes as we know them now will be obsolete both for showing prerecorded movies and for recording movies. People will record films on 8mm and will play them back using laser-disk/CD technology.I also am very, very excited by the fact that before long, alternative films will penetrate the entire country. Today seventy-five percent of the gross from a typical art film in America comes from as few as six --six-- different theaters in six different cities. Ninety percent of the American motion-picture marketplace never shows art films. With this revolution in delivery and distribution, anyone, in any size town or hamlet, will see the movies he or she wants to see. It will be the same as it's always been with books. You can be a hermit and still read any author you choose.Later in the interview Ebert says that \"by the year 2000 or so, a motion picture will cost as much money as it now costs to publish a book or make a phonograph album.\" Ebert was right, but it wasn't just film production and distribution costs that came down. With the rise of book self-publishing with sites like Lulu, the democratization of online music distribution with CD Baby, and the fact that I just can't keep up with the staggering volume of \"puppy tries to roll over but can't OMG how adorable\" videos, the internet really has fundamentally shaken up the media landscape.

        "text": "Terry R. Hiller wrote an article titled \"Going Shopping in the 1990s\" for the December, 1983 issue of The Futurist magazine. Mr. Hiller was understandably skeptical of the prospect of electronic shopping. However, many of the things he asserted would not come to pass did indeed happen.An excerpt appears below, along with graphics from the piece.Nor is electronic retailing equipped to deal with the logistics of delivery. Product information, selection, and billing can all be transmitted electronically, but physical merchandise must be physically moved. Today's mail-order houses depend on federal or private package delivery, services that are simply not structured for the huge traffic increases that large-scale teleshopping would generate. It would require not only the total restructuring of existing routes and systems, but an investment of billions of dollars in equipment and personnel - resources we are simply unable to spare either now or in the foreseeable future.Furthermore, since teleshoppers can only view products piecemeal, electronic marketing has severe drawbacks as a retailing device. In nine square feet of drugstore shelf space, you might easily encounter as many as 80 or more different brands and sizes of cold remedies. But in electronic marketing, shelf space is defined as time- the number of second an item appears on the screen. Allowing even 10 seconds per item, it would take more than 13 minutes to show that same 80 items. Add to this the cost of production, handling, and shipping, and we begin to suspect that the \"convenience\" of electronic marketing will be very expensive. Unless we are prepared to sacrifice variety - and therefore competition - some products will never be purchased \"in absentia.\"See also:Online Shopping (1967)Mobile Malls (1981)",

        "text": "This two-page spread from a 1982 issue of Electronic Games magazine is pretty spot on with many of its predictions. However, being \"chained to the family TV set\" isn't such a big deal when Little Johnny Future now plays on a 72-inch monster TV. Thanks to Paul H. for sending this article my way.The world of electronic gaming moves fast. The manufacturers regard any year that does not boast at least five major technological breakthroughs as a fallow twelve months. This time-lapse perspective makes foreseeing the future a particularly chancy business - predicting events weeks ahead can be perilous, crystal-balling the hobby as it will exist in the next century is like walking, unarmed into a dragon's lair. You might sneak out with the treasure, after all, but chances are you'll be incinerated. Keeping all this firmly in mind, the fact is that the calendar on the wall reads \"1982.\" We sit a little more than a year away from the day when George Orwell envisioned gigantic TV monitors in every home and on every street corner. Big Brother, he feared, would be watching us very closely.Actually, Orwell's vision was somewhat clouded. What he though were images of fascistic governmental overlords were, in fact, great big videogames! Those big-screen TV's arrived ahead of schedule, you see, so instead of using them to supress [sic] freedom, people decided to play games on them.Still, even 1984 is a good distance from 2001. Yet in researching the future of electronic gaming, certain fascinating bits of information and conjecture keep turning up again and again. Sitting down to put the puzzle together, at least a small portion of the future became clear. The smoke in the crystal ball began to dissipate and here's what we saw:Obviously computers will play a major role in the arcader's future. Some of them will be so specialized that they will realistically draw the player right into the contest. The computers will provide total sensory output: audio, visual, olfactory (smell), and tactile (touch). Systems can already be manipulated by voice commands, and even some home videogames are chatting happily back at us as well. Interactive fiction should continue to do well, as will role-playing games that involve the arcader in ever more personal ways (such as Prisoner and Network). Players will be able to assume the role of a detective, questioning the suspects in a murder case with full audio/visual accompaniment.Graphics are the fastest growing area of game design in less than a decade. Technology has jumped from Pong to Zaxxon, with Atari and other coin-op companies reportedly testing three-dimensional games in Europe.Look for arcades to be constructed along the lines of big-budget science fiction movie sets, with special effects a major attraction of the games. For example, there might be chairs that rock back and forth, swing from side to side or swivel a full 360 degrees.\"Gaming and interacting with machines is an appetite the public has only recently discovered,\" points out Tom Lopez of Activision. \"With our fast-progressing technology, one constantly updating and improving upon itself, the boundaries that confine most games will become limitless. The computer will soon become a daily tool used by everyone. As microprocessors and transistors become more refined and are, in turn, mass-produced, prices will drop. Computers continue to offer more capacity for less money. It will be cheaper - and more stimulating - to play computer games than to pay to be entertained at clubs or concerts, or in packed sports arenas.\"Since arcade games have the distinction of being designed for the purpose of executing one, specific program, they should be able to maintain an edge over home computers. The pay-for-play devices also utilize special monitors, that incorporate groundbreaking scanning technology, while home games remain chained to the family TV set.The arcade games of the next century may not only be activated by voice command, but conceivably even by thought - at least in a sense. Something akin to galvanic skin-monitoring devices attached to the gamer's arm, perhaps in the form of a bracelet, could measure emotional response and even act as a triggering device.In terms of futuristic audio, tomorrow's coin-ops - that is, if there still are such prehistoric items as coins still in use - will have miniature synthesizers to produce more highly defined sounds. There might even be devices to release pertinent smells at appropriate moments - the smell of gunfire for example. Such a machine could even blast the gamer with sound via headphones. Think about that for a second. Can you imagine the ambiance of a silent arcade? Now that would take some getting used to.Visually, an expanded screen could project pictures all around the player. Special effect would be attained, with shutter lenses that use a liquid crystal diffusion process, in which a cathode ray delivers one picture after another in synchronized fashion, so fast and so frequently that it generates a convincing illusion of movement.Picture this scenario: You are absorbed in a game of the future, seated within a totally enclosed environment. Images of shattering explosions, comets and asteroids whirl by as your seat shudders from the concussion. An asteroid passes so close you could almost etch your initials in its craggy surface. Over your headphones, meanwhile, your squad leader is passing on commands from headquarters. You have only split seconds to react, the results of an intergalactic battle hangs in the balance.\"When the games become transparent to the viewer, it will be so realistic, you'll feel you were there. Then the form of the game itself will disappear - as if it melted - and you will forget you're playing a game,\" predicts Lopez.\"We're rapidly reaching the point,\" concedes one computer expert, \"where technology is outstripping our ability to use it.\" The ability of the computers man has constructed begin to awe us with their blinding growth. The ultimate solution to this problem may be the development of team-designing as a way of life in the arcade industry of tomorrow.In the early days of videogames, a single individual created each program from conception to execution - everything but painting the title on the cabinet in some cases. As the sophistication of the industry grows, companies like Midway are setting up design teams, composed of people who specialize in each area of game invention. Some 16 creative artists and programmers combined talents to produce the marvelous Tron coin-op, with graphic concepts, audio effects and cabinet design handled by separate individuals under the supervision of a single manager.George Gomez, head of the Midway in-house research and development group agrees that teamwork is the key to future game design. \"It's too hard to find any one, or any two or three people with sufficient expertise in all the areas necessary to create a modern arcade game. We feel that areas such as cabinet and joystick design are vital elements in a game's success or failure.\"Whether or not we'll see these innovations in the next century, the next decade or, perhaps, never, depends on the direction in which this wildly unpredictable business moves in the time ahead. But one thing does seem certain - electronic gaming will never die.\"People need sensory interface,\" as Tom Lopez puts it, \"and electronic gaming gives that to people. More to the point, it's fun! Gaming is entertainment and it's here to stay!\"Even in the year 2001.Read more:Future Arcade Games (1985)Connections: AT&amp;T's Vision of the Future (Part 3, 1993)Computer Games of the Future (1981)Virtual Reality (1980s-today)Home Entertainment of the Future (1981) ",

Some environmentalists predict that CO2 pollution will create a canopy over the earth that will prevent heat from radiating into space. Most experts doubt that this effect will occur. Instead, many scientists are worried about a widespread, gradual cooling trend that could take hold by this year. If earth is indeed cooling, this climate change could signal the eventual onset of a new Ice Age that would slowly freeze much of the populated world by the year 12,000.See also:The Coming Ice Age (1982)Solar Energy for Tomorrow's World (1980)Closer Than We Think!

        "text": "Children of the 1980s were presented with two possible futures for government in the book World of Tomorrow: School, Work and Play. The first scenario is a nightmarish dystopia where governments track their citizens' every move and computers are curtailing freedoms across the globe. The second possible future is a utopia nearly achieving some form of direct democracy, brought on by the home computer and videophones, which enable citizens to become highly engaged in the political process.It would appear that those of us living in \"the future\" wound up with a bit of both. Governments all over the world are certainly using technology to spy on their citizens -- though I would wager that Visa, Apple and Google know more about me than the U.S. government. But the evolution of tools like Twitter and YouTube has also provided your average citizen with easier ways to politically organize and educate.Whatever your feelings on technology's role in government, I think we can all agree on one political truism... I'm right and those other guys are idiots.Some people fear that computers will rule our lives in the future. They believe that information on everyone will be stored in computers, and that government officials will be able to find out anything about anyone at any time. It is possible that this will happen, and that some governments will use computers to limit people's freedom. However, it is just as possible that computers will make governments more open in the future, and allow people more say in the ways they are governed.In a future where every home has a videophone computer system, everyone could take part in government. People could talk and air their views to others on special communication channels linking every home. These people would most likely be representatives of some kind -- of a political party, a union, an industry and so on.  But when the time comes to make a decision on any issue, everyone would be able to vote by instructing their computer. A central computer would instantly announce the result. This kind of government by the people is a possibility that the computer will bring. It could take place on any scale -- from village councils up to world government. In fact, it is more likely to happen in small communitites, as it would be difficult to reach effective national and international decisions, if millions of people always had to be asked to approve everything. Nevertheless, the computer will enable really important decisions to be put before the people and not decided by groups or politicians.The computer could also affect the ways in which politicians will work. They could discuss the issues that affect the people they represent over public communication networks that would replace governemtn assemblies. In this way representatives could live among their electors and get to know them and their views much better. ",

        "text": "This image from the book Tomorrow's Home (World of Tomorrow) by Neil Ardley illustrates the home entertainment system of tomorrow.This section's most interesting prediction may be that, \"the magazines, books, records, tapes and television sets we now have will begin to disappear. But in their place the computer will offer us a greater range of entertainment.\"The two page spread's text appears below in its entirety.Look at this play of the future - a performance of Shakespeare's Julius Caesar by famous actors in your very own living room! Even more amazing, you play the title role yourself. The play has just reached the point where Caesar is killed. All this could come about with developments in holographic video - a system that uses laser beams to produce images that have depth just as in real life. Once perfected, it will produce a show that takes place not on a screen but in real space - even around you. You could walk in and out of the action, and view it from any direction - the ultimate in realism.  In this case, the computer that operates the system has been instructed to omit the role of Julius Caesar so as to allow you to take part. Although the images look so real, you could walk through them, so you suffer no harm from your killers' knives.Such developments may lie far in the future, but there's no doubt that the computer is going to affect home entertainment soon. The magazines, books, records, tapes and television sets we now have will begin to disappear. But in their place the computer will offer us a greater range of entertainment.The home computer will be linked to a radio dish on your roof. A satellite or radio mast feeds it with many television channels; on the viewscreen of the computer, you can sit and watch the news or sport in several other countries as well as your own. The radio dish or telephone wires also link your home to computer complexes that feed it with all kinds of recorded entertainment - films, television shows you have missed, video magazines and news. Music comes through the computer too, playing whatever you want and whenever with a quality far beyond today's records and tapes. If you want to read something on your own, a portable screen linked to the computer displays any story of your choice.See also:Movie Trends of the 21st Century (1982)Living Room of the Future (1979)Thinks We'll Do Our Reading on Screen (1923)Learning in 1999 A.D.

        "text": "My girlfriend Malorie sometimes tells the story of a robotics video she watched in 8th grade Science class. One particular robot in this video had a broken wheel and found itself unable to turn. (Or, more appropriately, the robotics team that was steering the hunk of metal found themselves unable to turn the robot.) Malorie started sobbing softly.Try as it might the robot could not make its desired turn. Its little broken wheel jerked and jumped, but to no avail. Malorie then started crying uncontrollably, quietly pleading, \"Why won't someone help that robot! All he wants to do is pick up the ball and put it in the middle so that he can get some points!\"This may be an extreme example, but it illustrates our ability to anthropomorphize robots. We've seen that humanity's vision of robot servants is even older than the term robot itself but the household humanoid robot is still a technology of the future. The latter may have as much to do with cultural roadblocks to human-wannabes than technological hurdles.The introduction to the 1984 book If I Had a Robot: What to Expect from the Personal Robot speaks of this desire to see the artificial, mechanical man become \"real\" (provided they don't get out of hand). The book gives readers an imaginative peek at the personal robots just around the (1984) corner.A selection from the first chapter of the book appears below.Let us not shilly-shally in this matter; robots are interesting only insofar as they act like animals - nay, like people. The great romance of robotics is rooted in our longing for these artificial creatures to behave like natural creatures. Our images are muddled, of course. We look on robots as forbidden fruit - the Golem, brought to life by the improper use of arcane knowledge. We fear them as we fear the Frankenstein monster . . . deliciously. At the same time, we like them, root for them, support them, hope they'll turn our brave, strong, good, and caring. It's hard to say now whether Isaac Asimov, writing the stories collected in I Robot in the faraway thirties and forties, was creating new concepts, or recording the chiefly unarticulated views and expectations of society at the time. But certainly, Asimov's magnificently crafted stories have largely determined the expectations of everybody in the Western World with respect to robots. With due respect to writers Capek, Williamson, Saberhagen, and the others. Asimov has dominated robotics thought for some decades now. How many of us have been waiting, waiting for those critters to start appearing among us?And haven't we been lucky that Asimov is such an optimist! Logical purists may cavil at the Three Laws of Robotics, complaining, perhaps with reason, that the laws are inconsistent. That really doesn't matter. The robots in the stories are so likable - with an occasional rogue among them - that we want to deal with them directly, to get to know them, to be friends. All the automatic defenders and destroyers, are as nothing in our imagination, compared with Asimov's interesting creations, who try to make things work out for the better.That's quite an accomplishment. Whether he created it all out of whole cloth or crystallized the latent hopes and dreams of people in general, Asimov has powerfully influenced popular thought on robotics - for the good, many of us think. Certainly the Star Wars robots are in the Asimov mold, determined by the life experience of George Lucas and his associates, who grew up in Asimov robot tradition.And what about reality, if there is such a thing?See also:Will Robots Make People Obsolete?

This tube forms a ring over a mile in diameter. The tube houses the main living and agricultural areas and can support up to 10,000 people. The big wheel rotates once a minute. This makes an artificial gravity on the surface of the tube away from the center. \"Up\" is towards the hub and \"down is away from it.Sunlight is reflected from huge mirrors that can be adjusted to give as much or as little sunlight as required in different parts of the tube. The sunlight also gives the energy to drive the generators which produce the colony's electricity.Long \"spokes\" attach the tube to a central hub. At the hub there are docking ports for spaceships and vast antenna arrays for all the colony's communications with Earth.See also:Space Colony Pirates (1981)Sport in Space Colonies (1977)Space Colonies by Don DavisMore Space Colony Art (1970s)Mars and Beyond (1957)Challenge of Outer Space (circa 1950s)",

        "text": "The February, 1985 issue of The Futurist magazine featured a piece about a permanent settlement on the moon by 2007.NASA envisions the completion of a permanent settlement on the moon by the year 2007, the fiftieth anniversary of the space age. The final design of the base should be completed by the early 1990s, and construction might begin by the end of the decade.The lunar base was the topic of a recent three-day conference in Washington, D.C., that brought together scientists, engineers, former astronauts, anthropologists, and lawyers to discuss the future of the space program.The moon settlement would be the home of scientists and perhaps workers from private industry, NASA officials say. The base might be an international project, including Europeans, Japanese, and Soviets.The shuttle now operates on a relatively steady schedule, ferrying aloft a variety of experiments as well as scientists. NASA is also moving forward on plans for a permanently manned space station, due for completion in the early 1990s. These two programs are major steps toward establishing the lunar base. The shuttle would fly material and personnel to low earth orbit, and transfer them to the space station, which would serve as a \"halfway house\" between earth and moon. Objects brought to the space station by the shuttle would transfer into another reusable craft for the trip into higher orbits and eventually to the moon.The lunar base will probably be built mostly underground to protect the crew from cosmic radiation; unlike earth, the moon has no protective atmosphere to stop cosmic rays. The crew will number about one dozen; stays would vary between three months and one year, and the facility would be permanently staffed.Transport will be expensive and supplies costly. A pound of water brought to the moon today would cost as much as a pound of gold on earth. Fortunately, the moon is rich in many elements. Most of the materials needed for the base are available on the moon itself; over half the moon, for example, is made up of oxygen. Titanium, silicon, and aluminum are also found in abundance. But hydrogen - an essential constituent of water - is missing. Unless water is locked away at the lunar poles in the form of ice, this important element will have to be supplied from earth in order for the crew to have water.Previously on Paleo-Future:Space Colonies of the Year 2000 (1979)Moon Tourism (1988)Man and the Moon Filmstrip (1970s)Space Colony Possible (1975)Welcome to Moonbase (1987)NASA and the Internet ArchiveSpace Colonies by Don DavisMore Space Colony Art (1970s)",

Aggressive marketing techniques will also be used in the promotion of pay television and home video media.*Old-time movies - black and white films from the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s - will be electronically colored by computer techniques for a generation unfamiliar with the medium of black and white photography.*Trends at the theater concession stand may come and go, but popcorn will remain America's favorite movie-going snack.*Movie studios will continue to become electronic entertainment conglomerates. With their vast financial resources, these will be the only organizations capable of funding the giant spectaculars of the future. The trend is already exemplified by Universal, Paramount, MGM and Warner. Smaller experimental movies, on the other hand, will flourish with the availability of video to independent producers.*Though the techniques and technologies of movies are certain to change, movies will always be called movies.Citizen Kane, Gone with the Wind, Casablanca and The Godfather may very well be the only movies in history that haven't been remade.

        "title": "My First Thoughts on Paleo-Futurism (or how I learned to stop worrying and love Disney)",
        "text": "Me and Goofy (circa 1989)I've visited Walt Disney World about 20 times.Now, for an elderly woman living in Orlando, Florida, this might seem like an appropriate number. But for a 26-year-old man who's lived his entire life in the Midwest, that number is fairly absurd. My parents got me hooked at a young age, and while my perspective on the Disney brand and favorite activities in Disney World have both drastically changed over the years, I keep going back.It was in EPCOT Center that I first started thinking about paleo-futurism. By the mid-1990s, EPCOT was looking stale; a future frozen in the early 1980s. The park was almost a monument to a historical future, rather than a hopeful tomorrow, and even young children could sense this. Though an extreme comparison, it was somewhat like visiting Flushing Meadows to see the decaying remnants of New York's 1964 World's Fair.EPCOT as a theme park sparked my interest in this concept -- a concept for which I didn't yet have a name -- but one ride in particular stands out as the most reflective, yet forward-thinking. Horizons was opened in 1983 and featured both a history of the future, represented by an animatronic Jules Verne, and the future as imagined in 1983. Disney and this ride have so invaded my thoughts that any time I smell oranges I still imagine the \"farm of the future,\" as was briefly depicted during this ride.Though the ride closed in 1999, I can still play through every scene of Horizons in my head. The ride stands out as an experience that introduced me to thinking about histories of the future, and got me to thinking about what futures survive in our collective imagination. Like movies forever lost to history because of negligence and poor archiving, I feel a special sense of loss that most will never get to experience this ride in person.Oh well, at least Epcot still sells booze. Pour some out on the curb for Horizons. Or don't. That alcohol ain't cheap.The clip below is from the 1991 souvenir video, A Day at EPCOT Center.Horizons 1991Uploaded by paleofuturePreviously on Paleo-Future:EPCOT Publicity Materials (1981)EPCOT's HorizonsThe Simpsons Go To EPCOTAstuter Computer RevueMickey Futurism (1980s)Disney Calls Future a Thing of the Past (1997)",

To alter whole worlds, we would employ the tiniest of living things - minute plans called algae. Special new kinds of algae would be bred to be resistant to the conditions on Venus and Mars. Huge quantities would then be sent to the planets. On Venus the algae would convert the atmosphere of carbon dioxide into oxygen. Water could come from ice-bearing comets diverted to Venus. The temperature would fall until it was cool enough for people to land and begin making a new home there. On Mars the temperature would need to be raised by using the planets to darken and warm the white ice caps. The ice would melt and moisten the soil, releasing oxygen into the thin atmosphere. As the air thickened, it would get even warmer.See also:Space Colony Pirates (1981)Mars and Beyond (1957)The Future of Real Estate (1953)Vacations of the Future (1981)Space Spiders (1979) ",

        "title": "Nuclear Winter: Poetry for the Apocalypse (1986)",
        "text": "This past September I was wandering the shelves of a Half Price Books in Austin, TX when I stumbled upon the most peculiar little book. Titled Nuclear Winter, this book from 1986 was aesthetically unimpressive, with its cover design rivaling the very worst masturbatory self-published volumes on Lulu. I instantly thought that the washed out black of the cover was likely a product of poor printing from a small indie publisher rather than the 25 years it had been sitting dormant.Written by Stephen Daniel Mings, the book is a collection of 43 poems, each written from the perspective of a different person who has surivived a global nuclear war. Needless to say, it's a bit of a downer. This book of poetry is not recommended for getting your main squeeze in the mood, as Emily Dickinson's darkest lines would likely be more successful in that endeavor.Nuclear Winter presents the viewpoints of individual nuclear holocaust victims, some adult, some children, in different locations and circumstances, who have survived the first shock of a major nuclear war. The poems are arranged in the order I wrote them between October and December 1985. They reveal a world in the grip of nuclear winter where snow and ice, changed weather patterns and grey clouded skies are made worse by the radioactive refuse of a planetary nuclear battleground.My purpose is to alert the reader to the danger of a major nuclear war. I do not believe such a war is likely today, but it is more likely than it was ten or twenty years ago and if something is not done to prevent it, such a war will grow increasingly possible. Read the poems, see the consequences and avert the war. (February 1986) Below is poem number eleven, titled Dear Santa. Dear Santa, please hurry here.Our daughter Marie is only fourbut her logic is as clearas midnight broken by the searing lightof the bomb blast.She's afraid you aren't comingbecause the shelter has no chimney,only an air vent to filter out death.She smiled a little when we told hershe'd join you in heaven.But the morphine is almost gone and she won't be able to smile much longer. --a womanPuget SoundNorth America ",

The sequel picks up several years after where the 80-year-old original left off, with Rhett and Scarlett reuniting in their middle age, in 1880.

Still Gone sets out to prove that they do make 'em like they used to (Selznick Theater, 2:00 and 8:00 P.M.)The Apollo Mystery. Fine ensemble acting in this science fiction account of a murder during one of the Apollo Moon missions of the 1970s. The allure of the film, though, is in its setting; it was actually filmed on the Moon's surface during a commercial expedition last year. Very appropriate considering this weekend's anniversary. High production costs mean increased admission prices for this one, $15, only a dollar or two more than a regular ticket. (Roxie, 1:00, 3:15, 5:30, 8:00, and 10:15 P.M.)This Is Holorama. One of this summer's gimmick films, Holorama is another of those ultra-realistic holographic movie processes that only scare the kids and leave Mom and Dad with a sick feeling in their stomachs. Like other \"thrill films,\" it's mainly a travelogue, only this time the emphasis is on danger (an extended war sequence shot in the middle of battlefields in the Middle East, Central America, and Africa) and hostile environments. (We go inside an old-fashioned fission reactor during a real nuclear accident!) (Holostage, 2:00, 4:00, 7:30, and 10:00 P.M.)MusicAll-Star Simulated Symphony. Always a treat for lovers of classical music, this duo uses the latest in synthesizers and digital music techniques (and a few robots) to simulate a live performance of the world's greatest orchestra and recreate the sounds of legendary performers. A robotic Rachmaninoff has the piano solos in the highlight of the show. Gershwin's An American in Paris, conducted by an animatronic likeness of the composer. So real, you'd swear the players were alive and in the room. (Wozniak Hall, 8:00 P.M.)TelevisionDon't Mess with Me. Tonight mark's ABC's first attempt at a new English-language situation comedy in prime time since the network went to all-Spanish programming a few years ago. A summer replacement, the series brings back one-time child star Gary Coleman (has he ever been away?) who plays the father of two adopted children. Beats reruns, anyway. (7:30 P.M.)So Who Wants to Work? Jerry Rubin is the resident con man in a San Francisco retirement home where, ever since the collapse of Social Security, the old folks must rely on their wits to stay afloat. Rubin is particularly effective as the elderly baby-boomer wunderkind. In this episode, he convinces an oil company to use his pals in a TV commercial.

Where the very hugest super-computers of my lifetime, early in my lifetime, are now equalled by inexpensive personal computers that you can buy everywhere and anyone can own.

One of my earliest posts here at the Paleo-Future blog covered the EPCOT Center book, The Future World of Transportation. I vividly recall checking out the three books in this series from my elementary school library, my sticky fingers pawing through the technological promises Baby Boomers never saw materialize but insisted we Millennials would soon enjoy. Just over that horizon, just a little further! The year 2000 is going to change everything! We swear! The number is just so big. And round! 2000! Look at all those zeros. 2000!To the author's credit they figured out that to sound even remotely plausible and still make me wet my Underoos over the advanced technology featured in the book, one had to open with a year further out than 2000 A.D. And thus the first chapter, titled, \"Report From the Year 2050.\" Below are four renderings of technology we are certain to have by the year 2050 (if those lying, deceitful Baby Boomers are to be believed).Read more:Disney's Magic Highway, U.S.A.

        "text": "With Robert McCall's recent death at the age of 90 it seems fitting we take a look at the artist's statement he wrote for his 1981 show at the Scottsdale Center for the Arts, A Vision of the Future: The Art of Robert McCall. You'll notice that he uses the word \"artist\" quite often. Apparently he struggled to be recognized as an \"artist\" rather than an \"illustrator,\" which to him was a lesser term.I am living in the future I dreamed about when I was a young boy, and for me it is just as bright and wonderful as I imagined it would be. Many of the paintings in this exhibition are my current graphic thoughts about tomorrow.One of the joys of being an artists is the freedom to create one's own world, and through the use of brushes and paints, to explore that world and participate in adventures of the mind that the real world would not possibly provide. Like the real world, these excursions of the imagination are fraught with inaccuracies of perception -- it is rare that one glimpses through the veil of time even a hint of tomorrow's reality nor does it seem important to me, whether one's perceptions are right or wrong -- the pleasure is in making the predictions and doing the work.Today we live in a world filled with awesome possibilities, both good and bad. The rush of technology is so rapid, to stay abreast of it has become more and more difficult. Our understanding of the physical universe continues to grow and astonish us with its marvelous complexity.To be an artist in these times of explosive change is, for me, a privilege and a challenge. My goal is to document in my drawings and paintings a small part of this changing world and to anticipate in my work, the future that lies ahead.

But combine the idea of robot farms and the robot rebellion we looked at a few months back and you've got a hilariously horrifying combination.Look at this fruit farm of the future. There are at least three things that make it different from a farm of today. The first, of course, is that robots are picking the oranges. The second is that the orange trees are not growing in any soil. Now look at the landscape to spot the third difference. The farm is situated in an arid region where little rain falls from the sky. Today, such regions are virtually uninhabited and useless. These three difference show how robot farms of the future will be able to produce more food for the world's people than farming can today.See also:Superfarm of the Year 2020 (1979)Delicious Waste Liquids of the Future (1982)The Population Bomb: Scenario 1 (1970)The Population Bomb: Scenario 2 (1970)The Population Bomb: Scenario 3 (1970)The Robot Rebellion (1982)",

        "title": "Shopping in the Future (1981)",
        "text": "I'm often shocked at how accurate some 20th century predictions of online shopping were. However, these retail prognosticators frequently miss the mark by assuming that individual goods would need to be photographed or videotaped live for consumers. While I can kind of understand how this might make sense with fresh fruit, today we have sites like Amazon and Peapod where a generic photo of the product for sale is displayed. That being said, this prediction of online shopping from the 1981 book World of Tomorrow: School, Work and Play by Neil Ardley was pretty darn close to what we have today.A store of the future is more like a warehouse than a shop of today. The robots serve people who call up the store on their home computers. This robot is showing a bunch of bananas to a video camera, which transmits a picture of the fruit to a customer. It places the purchases in a box which is then delivered to the customer's home.Shopping is an activity that most of us have to do every day. While it's sometimes exciting -- if you want some new clothes or a new gadget, for example -- it's often tiresome. You have to trudge around a store, wait in line to pay for your purchases, and then perhaps carry a heavy load home only to find you've forgotten something.Shopping should be much easier and more enjoyable in the future. Computers and robots will come to your aid and enable you to shop at the very best stores. You won't have to lift a finger, let alone a shopping basket. For shopping will be yet another service that the home videophone computer will be able to provide.Instead of going out to the shops and stores in your town or city, you contact them through your videophone computer. You'll need to see what you're buying, even if you can't handle it, so the viewscreen of the videophone computer shows you the goods available. You then instruct the computer to order the goods you want and have them delivered to your house.Your computer \"talks\" to the store's computer, which in turn orders robots in the store to collect the goods together and pass them to a delivery vehicle. Under the guidance of the computers, this brings them to your home.In this way your home computer can make sure that your home is always supplied with all its essentials, for it automatically orders new supplies as soon as they are needed. It also instructs your bank to pay for the goods, so you do not need to part with any cash.Using the computer for shopping is yet one more way in which the computer will make life easier in the future. It will save you time that you spend in a more useful or a more pleasant way. However, many people enjoy shopping, especially looking for unusual items. So, while the computer will do your everyday shopping, you may still go shopping yourself for something special. However, the computer will be able to help you greatly if you want to buy something really exciting -- a special present for a friend, for example. With your home computer, you can purchase virtually anything in the world, for it can contact stories anywhere -- on the other side of the globe if necessary.

Interview with a Space FarmerIsland One, January 16, 2012On a recent tour through the Colonies of the United Universe, we stopped at Island One and talked with a farmer there:Q: At lunch today, the waiter told us that all the food on the menu was produced here on Island One. Do you import any food from Earth?A: No, it's too expensive. We raise every bit of food for all 10,000 of our citizens right her on this farm.Q: You must have a very large area under cultivation?A: Not really. We can grow all the food necessary to support one person in an area just 6 1/2 ft. long and 6 1/2 ft. wide. The entire farm takes up just 100 acres.Q: How can you raise so much food in such a small space? A: Well, for one thing, we raise most of our crops - hydroponically - in water instead of soil. That saves a lot of space because we can grow plants on tall vertical frames. Also, our farm produces food continuously - one crop after another, all year-round. It's always summer here, and we don't have any cloudy days or storms to contend with.Q: Do you raise any animals? A: Yes, they help us recycle leftovers. We raise our cows and goats almost entirely on corn stalks, cucumber vines and other crop wastes. Our chickens eat table scraps. Rabbits are our main sources of meat. They take up less space than hogs or cows and they need only half as much feed to produce a pound of meat. We also raise fish in those ponds over there.Q: Where do you get the. water for the fish ponds?  A: All the water in the colony is used over and over again. Water for drinking and cooking comes from the farm's dehumidifiers, which pull moisture out of the air. Waste water is purified in a solar furnace and then piped back to the farm. Q: Have you had any crop failures? A: Not so far. When we started the farm, we inspected the shipments of plants and seeds from Earth very carefully to make sure they didn't contain any weeds or insects. Now our farm is pretty much pest-free. Q: Do you miss your farm back on Earth? A: Not a bit! I've even learned to like rabbitburgers!

In Hal Lindsey's The 1980's: Countdown to Armageddon he boldly proclaims, \"The decade of the 1980s could very well be the last decade of history as we know it.\"I bought this book (originally published in 1981) at a Goodwill a few years back for the purpose of framing select pages. It always elicits a chuckle by those walking down the hallway of my apartment. While it may be funny to think that a man could write such a ridiculous book it is discouraging to think that this man still has a reputation to speak of. In a just society, this man would have been laughed off the face of the earth.As a public service I present the most hilarious of Hal Lindsey's claims for why the 1980s may, \"be the last decade of history as we know it.\"Mr. Lindsey personally met with a super-secret group of computer nerds whose prediction of world demise had mirrored that of Daniel, chapter 11, verses 40-45. (p. 6)Jim Jones was a false messiah as foretold in the Bible. (p. 21)Governments all over the world are being overthrown. (p. 23)By the year 2000 there will not be enough food on earth to keep people alive. (p. 26)The alignment of the planets will cause weather pattern shifts. (p. 28)Three Rabbis in 1980 all had the same dream of a messiah coming. (p. 48)UFOs are real and, \"demons will stage a human spacecraft landing on earth.\" (p. 33)Communism in the U.S.S.R. will overtake American dominace on the world stage. (p. 81)The U.S. itself will be \"taken over by communists.\" (p.132)The U.S. could be \"destroyed by a surprise Soviet nuclear attack.\" (p.132)The U.S. could \"become a dependent of the 10-nation European confederacy.\"  (p. 132)Needless to say, everything that Mr. Lindsey predicted came true and everyone in the United States that was a true-believing Christian was raptured into the heavens after the great 1980's Soviet attack upon U.S. soil (in which demon-aliens were involved.

        "text": "The May-June 1986 issue of The Futurist magazine ran an article titled, \"The Future of Personal Robots.\" An excerpt appears below.Robots can already be used to entertain young children. Their entertainment value for older children and adults, however, is for the most part limited to the intellectual challenge of programming them. But future robots will be complete home-entertainment centers, able to sing and dance and tell jokes, as well as control all your electronic entertainment equipment - TV, radio, stereo, computer games and telephone.Like many paleo-futuristic images of robots, the article imagines the robot as a mechanical person, one of the least useful forms a robot can take for those living in 2007. Taken literally, it is difficult to image the robot that will, \"sing and dance and tell jokes,\" being mass-produced anytime soon.Also, do the people above live in a house with kitchen counters just two feet tall or is Omnibot one hell of a jumper?See also:Closer Than We Think!

        "text": "For the October, 1980 issue of The Futurist Ted Peters, associate professor of systematic theology at the Pacific Lutheran Seminary (Berkeley, CA), wrote a piece titled, \"The Future of Religion in a Post-Industrial Society.\" An excerpt appears below.Western society is so pre-occupied with the consumption of goods and services that even religion may become just another commodity, like the packaged tour to an exotic island. If so, the world may lose a possible solution to its great crises. What is to become of religion as our society moves further and further into the post-industrial period? Certain trends are fairly easy to identify. For example, an extension of Islamic influence due primarily to the sudden expansion of wealth in Muslim hands. But I would like to bypass trends of this type and focus on something else, namely, the potential interaction between religion and the current understanding of the human self which has developed during the now passing industrial period.My thesis is that as our civilization becomes increasingly post-industrial, our preoccupation with consuming goods and services will most likely commoditize religion. There is now a strong trend - which I believe will continue - toward treating the moral and spiritual dimensions of life as commodities to be acquired and disposed of according to tastes and whims of shoppers in the religious marketplace.Excessive consumption, however, whether it be consumption of material goods or spiritual values, is the root of the crisis we call the \"world problematique.\" In addition, as long as the consumer mentality prevails, we will be condemned to a prostitution of the essential religious vision, a vision of the transcendent unity of all things which requires a sacrifice of the human ego. It is just such a vision, however, that holds the greatest promise for resolving the world problematique.See also:Headlines of the Near Future (1972)Future Shock (1972) ",

        "title": "The Future World of Transportation",
        "text": " I remember checking out this book at my elementary school library and being fascinated with the prospect of futuristic transportation.  In the second grade I even did a science project on \"Cars in the Year 2000.\"  (In 1992, the year 2000 still had some significance to a second grader.) My cars traveled on an electric grid throughout cities. Nowadays, my hope for the technology of the future mostly resides in ideas like wireless power and the prospect of setting up wireless power grids, much like the wireless internet infrastructure some cities are adopting.Chapter 1 of The Future World of Transportation opens with the ambitious \"Report from the Year 2050.\"  Their future is filled with \"Ultra Jets\" (described in the glossary as a double-decker plane of the future which loads passengers and cargo while hovering in the air) and \"autoplanes\" (a combination airplane and car) but, \"there is still only one terminal for space flight, the Earth International Space Port near Tucson, Arizona [which is] used largely by people who have business on the satellite space stations, or 'space-habs' or by those going to one of the new space station resorts.\"The second chapter is basically an advertisement for the now defunct World of Motion ride at EPCOT Center in Walt Disney World while the third chapter explores the history of transportation from the invention of the wheel to \"current\" flight technology. The fourth chapter is called \"Moving Ahead on Land\" and starts getting into some great paleo-futuristic territory with the \"Planetran, a sleek magnetic levitation train propelled by electromagnets, [that could] whisk passengers from New York to Los Angeles through underground tunnels in less than an hour.\"  Now that's what I'm talking about.The fifth chapter explores \"The Future at Sea\" and basically guarantees the young readers that they will see three-wheeled land/sea vehicles powered by water jets in their lifetimes.  The idea of their \"floating hotel\" is the most intriguing, as it appears that the hotel itself could, \"move between ports on a cushion of air at 50 miles per hour.\"  There appears to be no explanation necessary as to why someone would want a moving hotel in the paleo-future.Chapter six lays out the somewhat mundane history of speed on land, sea and in the air but gets into amazing paleo-futuristic territory with the demonstration of a WASP or Williams Aerial Systems Platform which, according to the glossary is \"a one-person flying device that is powered by a small turbofan engine.\" Personal rocket packs, here we come.The book ends with a chapter called \"Giant Steps into Space\" which, as we all know, is the final frontier. Again, I can't help but wonder if any publisher could put out such an earnest and optimistic book for children today.  The sincerity with which this book addresses the beautiful technology to come is astounding. Part of me laughs off everything in this book as fanciful and naive dreaming. Another part of me longs for that cynicism to be overtaken by hope for the future and the desire to again be amazed. Because, if the iPhone is the only thing that will revolutionize the way we live (as I believe on some level it will) we seem to be far from the \"future\" EPCOT sold us in 1982.(I also own The Future World of Agriculture and The Future World of Energy, so don't you worry, those are coming soon. Also, I'll Flickrize more photos from this great collection when I find more time.)",

        "text": "The 1981 children's book World of Tomorrow: School, Work and Play accurately predicted the rise of debit cards, but may have overstated how much safer we would be in the futuristic world of 2002. The phrase, \"in tomorrow's world computers will be able to guard over us,\" might seem humorous, given our current fears about online identity theft and high tech hegemony.But per usual, I tip my hat to the techno-utopian authors and illustrators of the 1980s who promised kids like myself a pretty incredible future. Well, I guess when those same authors and illustrators weren't making us soil our Underoos with tales of the coming robot uprising.Computers and robots will certainly be able to make life easier for you in the future - by allowing you to work, learn and shop at home, for example. But they also improve your life in several other ways, and one of the most important is that they will make your life safer than it is today.Even if you're lucky enough to have escaped harm, you probably know of someone who has had a car crash or been robbed. However, in tomorrow's world computers will be able to guard over us. Let's follow a day in the future and find out how.Imagine that you want to go into a city from your country home to watch a sports event. You leave your car at the city parking lot and then complete your journey by autotaxi and beltways. All these transports are guided and controlled by computers so that you travel in perfect safety. But you have to pay for your autotaxi ride, the sports match and a meal afterwards. Nevertheless, you walk about confident that no one will try to rob you. How can you be so sure? The answer is simple: you do not carry any money on you and neither does anyone else. You pay for everything you buy with an identity card like a credit card. it has a magnetic strip containing your name and other personal information in the form of a magnetic code that the computers in the autotaxi, the stadium and the restaurant can read. They simply contact your bank's computer and ask it to pay them the sums of money due to them. This done instantly, and you can check how much money you have left in your back account at any time.But someone might try to steal your card and use it to pay for anything they want. This would be now use, because you have to authorize every payment by giving the computer a secret code number or code word. Or the computer may check your thumbprint or voice to make sure that it is dealing with you and not someone pretending to be you.Previously on Paleo-Future:Credit Card Rings (1964)Computer Criminals of the Future (1981)Time Travel (1982)Robot Rebellion (1982) ",

        "text": "I can't believe it took me this long, but I figured out the universal writing formula for futurism! It just clicked after reading a 1980s newspaper article about robots! Let me know what I'm missing:Imagine [ten/twenty/fifty] years in the future.Your [car/toaster/robot] speaks to you.No, it's not your [friend/mom/crazy fever dream].Your life just got better* with technology![*If article appears between 1971 and 1979 replace \"better\" with \"shitty in the worst way\"] The December 8, 1985 Syracuse Herald Journal (Syracuse, NY) ran a piece about the personal robots of the future which uses this formula. The excerpt below quotes Nelson Winkless, author of the 1984 book, If I Had a Robot.Imagine driving down the highway 10 or 20 years from now. Suddenly, a small voice says, \"You haven't called your mother lately. Don't you think you'd better call her today?\"No, it's not your conscience. It's your own personal robot, a funny little creature that keeps track of your obligations and watches out for you.Of course, no one really knows what robots of the future will do to make your life easier. But a New Mexico robotics expert and author, Nelson Winkless, expects them to be more than mechanical housekeepers.\"Before we have robots that will do windows, we're going to have self-cleaning windows,\" he said, in a telephone interview from Corales, N.M. \"I expect them to be useful in ways yet unanticipated.\"Suppose you had this little guy bumbling after you, keeping track of things. You may come to a corner and he'll say, 'Why don't you slow down and watch out here?'\" says Winkless, who wrote \"If I Had a Robot: What to Expect of the Personal Robot\" (Dilithium Press, $9.95).\"We have just gotten to the point where we have (robots) that operate intuitively. They look at information and say, 'In all of my experience in life, what does this remind me of most?' They can see opportunities and problems and point them out.\"Joe Herrera, robot product manager for Tomy Corp., in Carson, Calif., thinks there will be \"a robot in every garage\" by the year 2000.\"One robot for the home may be able to wash your car and tell the kids stories,\" says Herrera, whose company manufactures robot toys.\"Right now, personal robots are in the same stage handheld calculators were 10 years ago.

        "title": "This future was made in a facility that also processes peanuts (1982)",
        "text": "I've never thought of my allergies as a big deal. Sure, my peanut allergy has caused an emergency room visit here and there, and my dad used to pick me up from sleepovers because of my emphysema-like wheezing around cats. No big thing, right? But a few years back it seemed about time I went to see an allergy specialist and get a comprehensive list of the things my body hates.I found myself shirtless, laying on my stomach in the doctor's exam room with twenty pricks in my back (which isn't nearly as scandalous as it sounds). A constant tingle ran through my body, but all I could think about was how comically small the exam room table appeared under my enormous body. I am most certainly not allergic to pizza and beer.To administer an allergy test a nurse needs to prick your back with an assortment of allergens. Different types of trees, animal dander, molds and grasses were all made to come into contact with my delicate, nature-hating skin. After the pricks, it's a waiting game to see if your torso turns into a red, puffy Braille haiku. About twenty minutes later the nurse knocked on the door. I couldn't see the expression on her face, given my vulnerable position facing the corner like the bad kid being punished. But her inflection said it all. \"Oh myyy!\" the nurse said in that heavy Minnesota accent most Minnesotans don't think they have. \"Well,\" she said with a pause, \"you're allergic to everything!\"\"Everything?\" I ask, worried less about the consequences of allergies and more about the cocky \"told you so\" attitude my girlfriend at the time was sure to have upon hearing the news.\"Well, maybe not the... yes, yes, you're allergic to grass too.\"I kind of guessed that one. My parents love to tell the story of when I was a kid and had just started to crawl. My dad spent a summer building a deck behind our house and he was able to leave me relatively unsupervised, as long as I was surrounded by grass. Sitting on a pastel pink blanket, I was content as all get-out not to traverse that sea of green, spiky irritants laid out before me. I've always been confused when someone appears pleasant while barefoot. I guess that's why I sometimes empathize with the wide-eyed technological visions of the 1950s. Their promise was one of control, of harnessing nature rather than being one with it. Domed cities, meal pills --science will have the answers.And science did have the answers in the 1982 kids book World of Tomorrow: Health and Medicine by Neil Ardley. Ardley's book is filled with predictions about the future of health care, with an emphasis on self-assessement via computer. If WebMD and the rise of home genetic testing kits count, I'd say that this was a pretty accurate vision of the future. Well, at least it was more accurate than the people who imagined hospitals in space. By checking the genetic codes of parents and by caring for unborn babies, the children of tomorrow should be born in perfect health. A long life is lkely to lie ahead of them. But to remain healthy, everyone will have to look after themselves. As now, this will mean taking exercise, keeping clean and behaving sensibly to avoid danger. However, the world of tomorrow will bring other ways in which you can help to prevent yourself from getting ill.Many people fall ill because they have an allergy. Something they eat or drink disagrees with them, or perhaps something in the air upsets them. Tiny particles of pollen blown by the wind give some people hay fever, for example. Others cannot eat food made from flour or shellfish without feeling ill. Often these people suffer for years before they find out what is wrong.In the future you will be able to go to the doctor or a health complex to prepare yourself for a healthy life. Machines will take samples such as blood, saliva, hair and body wastes. They will measure them to find out exactly how your body reacts to food and drink and to substances in air and water. Then a computer will take the measurements and work out which things are likely to cause problems for you. It will produce a personal list of things to do and to avoid if you want to stay healthy and feel alert and full of energy. It is certain, for example to insist that you should never smoke. It may even recommend certain rules for making the best of your memory and intelligence. Following a list of rules might seem to make life a lot less fun. However, it would probably be no more trouble than taking care when crossing the road, for example.",

Today we have a letter from Jenny, writing her friend Susan about the amazing space hotel she's visiting in the year 2002. Having graduated high school in the year 2002, I'm a little disappointed that my graduation ceremony wasn't held at a space hotel, complete with space pool and the accompanying physics that go along with that.April 16, 2002 Dear Susan,We arrived at the space hotel yesterday, and the first thing I did was try out the swimming pool. It really is as much fun as everyone says, but the low gravity takes getting used to. Everything happens more slowly than usual - you feel as though you're part of a movie that's being show in slow motion. When you jump off the diving board, you can easily do two or three somersaults before you hit the water - and when you do go in, you leave a hole which takes a few seconds to fill up. The pool doesn't look anything like the ones on Earth. It's like an enormous barrel with water lining the inside. The barrel rotates very slowly, creating just enough force to keep the water pushed up against the sides. When you're in the pool, you can see water curving uphill and people swimming upside down overhead. As if that isn't strange enough, you can also see people floating through the air in the zero-g area at the center of the barrel. To get there, all you have to do is jump high off the diving board and flap your arms like wings. If you hold a paddle in each hand, it's easier to steer. I want to tell you about all the other things I've done, but there isn't time. I'll write again tomorrow.Love, JennyRead more:Vacations of the Future (1981)Moon Tourism (1988)Welcome to Moonbase (1987)The Kids' Whole Future Catalog (1982)Factories in Space (1982)New Worlds to Radically Alter (1981) ",

You'll want to enjoy this extra time - and here computers and robots will again come to your aid. Suppose you feel like a vacation. Planning it is easy. On the viewscreen of your home videophone computer, you watch video guides that show any place in the world - or out of it. Eventually you choose your destination - the Space Islands. These are a group of huge space colonies that are resorts for people from Earth, the Moonbase and other space colonies. They have different climates in order to attract all kinds of tourists, and you choose a colony that is like several South Sea islands inside. However, unlike the real South Sea islands, you can play weightless games there and experience other such delights that only the Space Islands can offer.Getting from your home to the colony is a long and complicated journey, but your computer arranges all the various stages of the trip, books your seats, reserves your hotel rooms . . . and pays your bills.Then it's off on a whole variety of robot transports as exciting as the vacation itself - beltways, autotaxis, high-speed monorail trains, underground vacuum bullet trains, mammoth jets, space shuttles and finally a spacecruiser out of the colony.You're there at last, and a wonderful vacation lies before you. There's only one problem - no one speaks English. The Space Islands are designed to suit all the people on Earth, and so their languages vary. You've chosen one in which Spanish is spoken. You can't speak Spanish, so you hire a portable computer that translates instantly from one language to another.See also:Language of the Future (1982)Man and the Moon filmstrip (1970s)The Future of Real Estate (1953)Year 2000 Time Capsule (1958)Connections: AT&amp;T's Vision of the Future (Part 1, 1993)Vision (Clip 1, 1993) ",

        "text": "Imagine LinkedIn, with fewer networking tools and more VHS tapes of you performing awkward magic tricks. That seems to be the future of job-hunting according to this article from the October, 1989 issue of Omni magazine.I mean, even Arthur Radebaugh's prediction 40 years earlier of interviews via videophone was closer to the mark.A standard printed resume suggests little, if anything, about how a job candidate talks, acts, and looks. But now there is a video resume, giving a prospective employer the chance to size up the person before the interview takes place.Advantages? An employer can judge how well personalities will mesh before subjecting himself or the applicant to the pressure of a face-to-face interview. Just pop the video resume into a VCR.It's also advantageous for the job seeker. \"Paper resumes screen you out. Video resumes get you screen in,\" says John B. Kelman, president of Res-A-Vue, a video marketing company in Connecticut. \"You can really put your best foot forward - no interruptions, no smoke blowing in your face.\"Video resumes run about five minutes and cost from several hundred to several thousand dollars. To prepare one, a job seeker tells about his abilities and ambitions before a studio camera. The tape is then edited, complete with on-screen titles and background music.The video resume can be used to illustrate skills that might seem unimpressive on paper. For example, a human resources vice-president prepared a video resume in which he performed magic tricks. It was shot on location all around the country. The cost: $12,000. In another instance, a scientist gave a video to his boss to prove he was management material. Says Lise Christensen, a public relations executive who recently found a job by using a video resume, \"Employers get to meet you. You have an edge over anyone with only a piece of paper.\" Previously on Paleo-Future:One-World Job Market (1959)The End of Work (1966)Little Work, Big Pay Forecast for Year 2000 (1969) ",

        "text": "10 Zen Monkeys has a great article about the paleo-futuristic promise of Virtual Reality. As the article points out, we may have things like Second Life, which is mentally gripping but is far less physically immersive than what was projected.I remember looking at Nintendo's Virtual Boy in the mid-90s and thinking, \"Finally! It's just a matter of time before virtual reality takes over the gaming market.\"Jaron Lanier, the developer that was interviewed for the 10 Zen Monkeys article has a Top Eleven Reasons VR Has Not Yet Become Commonplace. It's worth a look. I find number 7 the most intriguing in a lot of ways.\"Because human acuity is so good that you can't get away with so-so specs as you can when the interface is less intimate, as with existing mass produced devices.\"  I can't decide if the Wii proves number 7 or shows that technologies that are becoming more immersive are more attractive for their playability than their graphics.The image above is from the Walt Disney World attraction Carousel of Progress which was updated in the late 1990s to include a futuristic family playing a virtual reality game.",

A 1995 prediction by Bill Gates about \"the internet as a self-publishing medium\" was met with great skepticism due to the lack of editors and, believe it or not, a Dewey decimal system on the web. An excerpt from the book appears below:The lack of an equivalent to the Dewey decimal system on the Internet is a different matter. While it is true that experienced Internet users can eventually find what they're looking for, [Clifford] Stoll and other critics insist that it takes more expertise and time than Internet enthusiasts are willing to admit. This point of contention may eventually be answered by software developments that are still just blips on the horizon. But such a development, according to many experts, including both Internet boosters and doubters, is likely to have to await a formalized method for paying royalties to those who self-publish on the Internet. Bill Gates is sure this can be managed down the line, but as things stand there are still vast legal tangles to be resolved concerning payment to original authors whose work is published by major companies, let alone compensation for self-publishing.Previously on Paleo-Future:The Internet?

        "title": "Disney Calls Future a Thing of the Past (1997)",
        "text": "As I've argued before 1997 can be seen as the year that postmodern paleo-futurism went mainstream. Disney's self-aware redesign of Tomorrowland meant that mainstream American culture was out of ideas for the future.It was as though the people at Disney were throwing up their hands and saying, \"The year 2000 is just around the corner! Without flying cars we've got nothing! Check your parent's attic, there must be something cool up there!\"The most sincere and sentimental company in America had decided to simply co-opt past visions of the future.The excerpt below is taken from a February 23, 1997 New York Times article that sums up the Tomorrowland redesign and what it meant for futurism.''The new Tomorrowland begins with Jules Verne and ends with Buck Rogers,'' said Beth Dunlop, a Florida architecture critic who recently released a company-approved book on Disney architecture.Tomorrowland is hardly alone. The future is growing old all over Disney's magic kingdom. From the film lot to the Epcot theme park to the real-life town that the company calls Celebration, Disney has largely given up on imagining a new future. When a story line or ride design calls for a touch of times to come, it is usually, as posters for the new Tomorrowland boast, ''the future that never was.''The shift is profound for a company whose founder was one of postwar America's great popularizers of technology. And it is a reflection of the ennui that many Americans, at century's end, feel about the chips and bits in which they are immersed.''We went to the Moon and all we got out of it was Teflon pans,'' said Karal Ann Marling, a professor of art history and American studies at the University of Minnesota, expressing an increasingly common attitude.''Our goals as a people are not these pie-in-the-sky objectives that people grew up with in the 50's,'' said Professor Marling, who is the curator for a Montreal exhibit in June on Disney theme park architecture. ''They settle now for a house in the suburbs and to hell with the Moon. What's the point of building monorails if we can hardly get the car to work?''See also:Postmodern Paleo-FutureArticle for MungBeing",

        "text": "After reading Gizmodo's interview with a technosexual I thought it was as good a time as any to look at an article from the July-August, 1997 Futurist about sex with robots.Joel C. Snell wrote a piece called, \"Impacts of Robotic Sex,\" which describes many of the same reasons for wanting a robotic sex partner as Zoltan does in the Gizmodo article. Alimony, disease, and a sense of shifting cultural norms all lend themselves to a tone of inevitability in both pieces. The more tomorrow changes, the more it stays the same. The Futurist magazine article appears below in its entirety.(The robot to the right is a painting my girlfriend, Malorie Shallcross, did for Valentine's Day.)Robots that provide sexual companionship are likely to become common in the future. Prototype models have already been reported from Japan. The future \"sexbots\" will have humanlike features and will be soft and pliant, like the latest dolls for children. Sexbots will contain vibrators to provided love talk.Sexbots will be disease free; they won't judge one's sexual performance, and they won't say no. They will never have a headache or demand alimony.They could certainly alter human relations. Here are a few potential impacts of sexbots:Marriages may be destroyed by sexbots. A husband chooses sex with the sexbot, alienating his wife; the jealous wife destroys her sexbot rival and sues the manufacturer.Individuals may change gender orientation. Heterosexual people may use a same-sex sexbot to experiment with homosexual relations. Or gay people might use other-sex sexbots to experiment with heterosexuality.Robotic sex may become addictive. Sexbots would always be available and never say no, so addictions would be easy to feed. People may become obsessed by their ever faithful, ever pleasing sexbot lovers and rearrange their lives to accommodate their addictions. Eventually, support groups will likely form.Technovirgins will emerge. An entire class of humans may emerge who not only will never have sex with other humans, but won't even desire it.Robotic sex may become \"better\" than human sex. Like many other technologies that have replaced human endeavors, robots may surpass human technique; because they would be programmable, sexbots would meet each individual user's needs.Would electronic and robotic sex reduce teen pregnancy, sexually transmitted diseases, abortions, pedophilia, and prostitution? The jury is still out on these implications. However, boundaries, barriers, and beliefs will be challenged.See also:Civilized Adultery (1970)Headlines of the Near Future (1972) ",

        "text": "The January 24, 1996 New York Times ran an article titled, \"In A Cashless Future, Robots Will Cook.\" An excerpt appears below. You can read the entire article here.It's a typical day in the year 2006. After a hectic afternoon of negotiating contracts with business partners in Hong Kong, London, Moscow and the Bronx, you step from your office and into your kitchen. What's for lunch? You press a hand on your personal diagnostic machine, and quicker then you can say Michael Jackson does Sinatra, the unit checks your blood pressure, cholesterol and weight-fat ratio and reads out your nutritional requirements. Up pops suggested menus.Kitchen robots quietly go to work moving ingredients from a \"smart\" refrigerator that is built into a microwave oven. A minute later, out rolls a garden salad with dill dressing and an open-face pork-roast sandwich on wheat -- no crust. After lunch, you return to your home office to finish some business in South Africa. If you're done early, maybe you can squeeze in a movie: \"Gone With the Wind\" you reconfigured with Bruce Willis as Rhett Butler.For much of human history, talk of the future was relegated to the musings of self-described prophets, astrologers, dreamers and fools. But as the world lurches toward the 21st century, futurism is being taken more seriously by more people. Experts of all stripes are studying the patterns of the past and present, trying to project tomorrow. Forecasts of what might be spill out of corporate boardrooms, government offices, magazine stands, talk shows and bookstores like a bubbly brew.See also:1999 A.D.

I disagree with that view. People recognize the newspapers they subscribe to.....and there is a loyalty attached to those.In short, \"the technologists\" were right.

        "text": "In his 1991 book, Facing Tomorrow, author Thomas Hine opens with a decidedly pessimistic tone. The first chapter, \"The End of the Future,\" expresses a feeling of betrayal that the world did not provide the future humanity was promised. An excerpt from that chapter appears below.For at least two decades, no compelling, comprehensive vision of the future has captured the American imagination. Our culture is like a child raised without adults: We have no idea what we will be when we grow up. We don't know what to tell our own children, though we dimly suspect we are setting a bad example. We condescend to past visions of the future - the progressivist utopias of the turn of the previous century, the streamlined dreams of the 1930s, the jet age exuberance of the 1950s. But we have nothing to take their place.Instead, our popular culture is filled with tainted dreams, manipulated horrific fantasies planted in the minds of innocents, which come true when Freddy Krueger, the sleep-invading slasher from the endless Nightmare on Elm Street movie cycle, comes to eviscerate the dreamer and most of her friends, relatives and neighbors. Today, we know all about what was wrong with the visions of the past and are, we tell ourselves, more realistic. But we are more limited, too. Besides, there's no evidence, outside of the movies, that a refusal to dream prevents nightmares from coming true.When the world does not seem to be going your way, it is worth finding out which way the world is going. If progress seems self-defeating, it is time to come up with a new definition of progress. It's time for a new future, one that will enable us [to] make sense of the present and judge how the actions we take each day will shape tomorrow. We need to understand our past ideas of the future, in part so that we can understand the ways in which we have gone wrong. But we can't slap a new coat of paint on our old tomorrows. We need to conceive of our future new and whole, from the ground up. We have to examine our fears, to see if they are real, and our desires, to understand what we really want and what we can hope to get. Today, people become angry at the future because it is not going to provide what was once expected. We need a clearer idea of what we can anticipate, what we can achieve, what we can create, so that we can once again feel the exaltation of moving toward something we want rather than the bitterness of settling for less.Progress to Counter Catastrophe Theory?

Author Clifford Stoll proclaims, \"no online database will replace your daily newspaper, no CD-ROM can take the place of a competent teacher and no computer network will change the way government works.\" You can read the piece in its entirety here. Excerpts appear below.Every voice can be heard cheaply and instantly [on the Internet]. The result? Every voice is heard. The cacophany more closely resembles citizens band radio, complete with handles, harrasment, and anonymous threats. When most everyone shouts, few listen. . . . Nicholas Negroponte, director of the MIT Media Lab, predicts that we'll soon buy books and newspapers straight over the Intenet. Uh, sure.These expensive toys are difficult to use in classrooms and require extensive teacher training. Sure, kids love videogames--but think of your own experience: can you recall even one educational filmstrip of decades past?We're promised instant catalog shopping--just point and click for great deals. We'll order airline tickets over the network, make restaurant reservations and negotiate sales contracts. Stores will become obselete. So how come my local mall does more business in an afternoon than the entire Internet handles in a month? Even if there were a trustworthy way to send money over the Internet--which there isn't--the network is missing a most essential ingredient of capitalism: salespeople.See also:The Answer Machine (1964) ",

Hyatt is pretty pessimistic about mankind's future, given the \"Y2K problem.\" Ironically, Mr. Hyatt blogged more recently about cynics who are pessimistic about the future. He says that real leaders \"look on the sunny side.\" Priceless turnaround.As ridiculous as the hysteria over Y2K may have been, it was certainly more palatable than the current \"2012\" nonsense. Whatever happened to being afraid of a good, old-fashioned robot uprising?My favorite warning from the front cover of the book says that the \"illusion of social stability is about to be shattered . . . and nothing can stop it.\" If this is even remotely true, why buy this book? Do you feel as if you're living with the \"illusion of social stability\"? Might we all crack in a moment's notice? Does every generation feel so special as to believe they live in the End Times?The rest of the supposed \"catastrophic results\" of the Y2K bug were outlined on the book's back cover:Social security checks will stop coming.Planes all over the world will be grounded.Credit card charges will be rejected.Military defense systems will fail.Police records and emergency communications will be inaccessible.There will be massive, long-term power failures.Bank funds will be inaccessible.Insurance policies will appear to have expired.Telephone systems will fail to operate.IRS tax records and government funds will be unavailable.The Federal Reserve will be unable to clear checks.Time security vaults will fail to open or close on time.Traffic signals will fail to function.Office systems will fail and your employer will go out of business.

It's just a matter of time before virtual reality takes over the gaming market.\"Jaron Lanier, the developer that was interviewed for the 10 Zen Monkeys article has a Top Eleven Reasons VR Has Not Yet Become Commonplace. It's worth a look. I find number 7 the most intriguing in a lot of ways.\"Because human acuity is so good that you can't get away with so-so specs as you can when the interface is less intimate, as with existing mass produced devices.\"  I can't decide if the Wii proves number 7 or shows that technologies that are becoming more immersive are more attractive for their playability than their graphics.The image above is from the Walt Disney World attraction Carousel of Progress which was updated in the late 1990s to include a futuristic family playing a virtual reality game.",

        "text": "In 1991 the Walt Disney Company announced plans for a 470-acre expansion of its presence in California. This expansion was to include an \"EPCOT West\" or Westcot. The proposal is interesting if only for its ambition. Westcot was to be a \"World's fair-type attraction in Anaheim,\" with the featured attraction being a 300-foot-tall Spacestation Earth, modeled after the 180-foot-tall Spaceship Earth in Florida's Epcot Center.According to a New York Times article from December 13, 1991:\"The heart of the new resort will be Westcot, with Spacestation Earth at its center and, fanning outward, pavilions named the Wonders of Living, the Wonders of Earth and the Wonders of Space, along with cultural exhibits. 'Westcot is expected to draw 10 million visitors in its first year,' said Kerry Hunnewell, vice president for the Anaheim Project.\"According to the New York Times, the head of the Westcot project resigned in December of 1993 without any reason given.Many Disney-related blogs including Jim Hill Media, 2719 Hyperion, and Mickey News have covered this story if you're looking for more information.See also:EPCOT's Horizons 19 Feb 2007The Simpson's go to EPCOT 14 Feb 2007Astuter Computer Revue 8 Feb 2007",

        "title": "Writer and Producer of Connections: AT&amp;T's Vision of the Future",
        "text": "As a writer and producer for the 1993 video Connections: AT&amp;T's Vision of the Future, Henry Bassman has a fascinating link to the paleo-future. Bassman worked at AT&amp;T for almost thirty years. While there, he worked on technology videos, the introduction of cellular telephone systems, UNIX, optical communications systems, advanced microprocessor technology, among many other things.I sent Henry a few questions and he was kind enough to send back some answers.1. Who was the audience for Connections and how was it distributed?The audience was highly diverse -- from young adults in universities to successful business people.  We wanted to demonstrate our technology vision for the future of communication and enlist people into signing up for that future.  We gave away hundreds of copies, offered them to schools and other institutions on loan and sold copies.2. How were the “technologies of the future” conceived?First I convened a group of technology-savvy communicators since scientists and engineers tend to be poor prognosticators.  We developed a number of scenarios that we thought were possible.  I developed those scenarios into one or two paragraph capability descriptions and circulated them among AT&amp;T's leading scientists and engineers in Bell Labs, Lucent, and AT&amp;T headquarters.  We winnowed out the ones the experts said were unlikely in our 12-14 year timeframe, made changes in others and came up with a list of potential new capabilities. Then I went to Universal Studios and Disney Studios to interview writer/directors and production companies.  We chose Universal because they gave us the most creative script ideas.  We wanted to demonstrate that people and their basic needs would not change in our timeframe but that new technology would help them achieve those needs in a more fulfilling and less stressful way.  Then we wrote a script that incorporated most of the scenarios we had developed.  We showed people going through their normal lives - working, getting married, fishing, having community conflicts, going to school and used what we knew to be the technology possibilities to accomplish those purposes. We even demonstrated how something as mundane as buying a rug could become a more satisfying experience with technology of the future.  We did not include people having their refrigerators restocked automatically for example because we guessed a)  there was too much investment in brick and mortar for supermarkets and b) food shopping is as much impulse buying as planned buying.  Besides, for many people a trip to the supermarket is an outing rather than a chore.3. What technology did you hope would catch on but didn’t?I sure wish I had a dungeons and dragons game.  That would be cool.  Incidentally I based the game concept on Adventure, which used to come with every UNIX tape.  I also wish I had one of those intelligent agents who I could command verbally to do all my dirty work.  I still do most of my input via keyboard.  Only the agent would look more like Pamela Anderson than Sidney.  When Sidney says \"I am sorry Ian, I am not permitted to divulge that information,\" it came straight from UNIX permissions.4. What technology featured in the video was the most prescient?The ubiquitous use of computers for networking, accessing information, accomplishing work, shopping and socializing.  This video was made several years before Netscape.  There was no common awareness of the Internet.  Internet is not even used in the video.  At the time even email required some sophistication to use.  Some people thought we were exaggerating the central role computers would play in people's lives, but you can see we may have even underestimated in that regard.5. Were there any technological advancements you thought about including but were too far-fetched for the time?Teleportation was not included because it defies physics.  \"Beam me down Scotty\" is a wonderful fancy, but not possible based on our present knowledge of physics.6. It seems that the networks AT&amp;T envisioned at the time were much more centralized than the current version of the Internet. Was AT&amp;T working on the infrastructure of such a network at the time?The voice telephone network and the video networks are still centralized and to some extent hierarchal.  The phone companies are just now talking about building Internet Protocol infrastructures.  Cable television is also centralized as is satellite television and radio.  My understanding is that the Internet is a backbone network that operates in a non- hierarchal way but is accessed by ordinary users such as ourselves through these traditionally hierarchal networks.  Large businesses bypass the traditional networks with private digital networks they either build themselves or lease from network providers.  So, communications continues to be controlled by the network owners who provide access for a fee.  Once on the network, you can use as much as you want and can for the access fee.  Even then, providers, like Comcast, reserve the right to restrict your amount of usage or terminate service if you use too much.7. Is there any more info you’d like to give about Connections?Making the program was a highlight of my career at AT&amp;T.  I made lifelong friends during the project and felt more creative and unrestrained than at any time in my AT&amp;T career.  I am delighted that people are still watching the program and that we hit the mark on some developments that have already come to pass and others that are still in the future.  I am sorry that we failed to see how ubiquitous, convenient and affordable wireless telephony would become.  A mobile phone was extremely expensive to buy in those days; it was bulky and the minute by minute rates were very high.  Today I own five mobile phones (one for each member of my family) and would not leave home without my Palm Treo, which is a hybrid telephone/computer.
